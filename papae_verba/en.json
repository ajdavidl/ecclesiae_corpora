            "Missionaries always proclaim a message of salvation to everyone; not only those missionaries who go afar, but we too, [are] Christian missionaries who express a good word of salvation. This is the gift that Jesus gives us with the Holy Spirit. All of this signifies that the Kingdom of God is built day by day and already offers on this earth its fruits of conversion, of purification, of love and of comfort among men. With what spirit must disciples of Jesus carry out this mission? First of all they must be aware of the difficult and sometimes hostile reality that awaits them. Hostility is always at the beginning of persecutions of Christians; because Jesus knows that the mission is blocked by the work of evil. For this reason, the laborer of the Gospel will strive to be free from every kind of human conditioning, carrying neither purse nor bag nor sandals (cf. v. 4), as Jesus counseled, so as to place reliance solely in the power of the Cross of Jesus Christ. This means abandoning every motive of personal advantage, careerism or hunger for power, and humbly making ourselves instruments of the salvation carried out by Jesus\u2019 sacrifice.

            "The characteristic of the missionary\u2019s style is, so to speak, a face, which consists in the poverty of means. His accoutrement responds to a criteria of modesty. Indeed the Twelve have the order to \u201ctake nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts\u201d (6:8). The Teacher wants them to be free and unhampered, without reserves and without favours, certain only of the love of the One who sends them, strengthened only by his Word which they go to proclaim. The staff and the sandals are the gear of pilgrims because that is what the messengers of the Kingdom of God are, not omnipotent managers, not irreplaceable officials, not celebrities on tour. (Angelus, 15 July 2018)",

The narrative indicates this by using a series of verbs of which he is the subject \u2014 \u201cHe called to himself\u201d; \u201che began to send them\u201d; \u201che gave them authority\u201d; \u201che charged them\u201d, \u201che said to them\u201d \u2014, so that this going out and the work of the Twelve appears to be radiating from a centre, reaffirming the presence and work of Jesus in their missionary actions. This demonstrates that the Apostles have nothing of their own to proclaim, nor any abilities to manifest, but rather that they speak and act as \u201cemissaries\u201d, as messengers of Jesus.

            "God\u2019s great freedom in giving himself to us represents a challenge and an exhortation to modify our behaviours and our relationships.

Among ourselves. This is a Christian community. (Santa Marta February 7, 2019)",
            "No Christian proclaims the Gospel \u201con his/her own\u201d, but is only sent by the Church who received the mandate from Jesus himself. Indeed it is Baptism that makes us missionaries. A baptized person who does not feel the need to proclaim the Gospel, to proclaim Jesus, is not a good Christian.\nThe second characteristic of the missionary\u2019s style is, so to speak, a face, which consists in the poverty of means.

The staff and the sandals are the gear of pilgrims because that is what the messengers of the Kingdom of God are, not omnipotent managers, not irreplaceable officials, not celebrities on tour. Let us think for example of this Diocese of which I am Bishop. Let us think about some saints from this Diocese of Rome: Saint Philip Neri, Saint Benedict Joseph Labre, Saint Alessio, Blessed Ludovica Albertoni, Saint Frances of Rome, Saint Gaspare del Bufalo and many others. They were not officials or business people, but rather humble workers of the Kingdom. This was the face they had. And to this \u201cface\u201d also belongs the way the message is received: it can happen that one is not welcomed or listened to (cf. v. 11). This too is poverty: the experience of failure. The experience of Jesus who was rejected and crucified anticipates the destiny of his messenger. And only if we are united to Him, who died and Rose, can we find the courage to evangelize. (Angelus, 15 July 2018)",
            "The Gospel passage pauses on the style of the missionary which we can sum up in two points: the mission has a centre; the mission has a face.\nFirst of all, the missionary disciple has his centre of reference who is Jesus himself. The narrative indicates this by using a series of verbs which have him as the subject \u2014 \u201cHe called to him\u201d; he \u201cbegan to send them\u201d; he \u201cgave them authority\u201d; \u201che charged them\u201d, \u201che said to them\u201d (vv. 7, 8, 10) \u2014, so that the going out and working of the Twelve appears to be radiating from a centre, reaffirming the presence and work of Jesus in their missionary actions. This demonstrates that the Apostles have nothing of their own to proclaim, nor any abilities to manifest, but rather that they speak and act as \u201cemissaries\u201d, as messengers of Jesus.\nThis episode of the Gospel also applies to us and not only to priests but to all baptized people called to witness to the Gospel of Christ in the various spheres of life. And for us too, this mission is authentic only in so far as its unchanging centre who is Jesus. It is not an initiative of faithful individuals nor of groups and not even of large gatherings. It is the mission of the Church, inseparably united to her Lord. No Christian proclaims the Gospel \u201con his/her own\u201d, but is only sent by the Church who received the mandate from Jesus himself.

            "Simeon, moved by the Spirit, sees and recognizes Christ. And he prays, saying: \u201cMy eyes have seen your salvation\u201d (v. 30). This is the great miracle of faith: it opens eyes, transforms gazes, changes perspectives. As we know from Jesus\u2019 many encounters in the Gospel, faith is born of the compassionate gaze with which God looks upon us, softening the hardness of our hearts, healing our wounds and giving us new eyes to look at ourselves and at our world. New ways to see ourselves, others and all the situations that we experience, even those that are most painful.  This gaze is not na\u00efve but sapiential. A na\u00efve gaze flees reality and refuses to see problems. A sapiential gaze, however, can \u201clook within\u201d and \u201csee beyond\u201d. It is a gaze that does not stop at appearances, but can enter into the very cracks of our weaknesses and failures, in order to discern God\u2019s presence even there. (Homily, 2 February 2022)",
            "Jesus\u2019 parents go to the Temple to attest that their son belongs to God and that they are the guardians of his life, and not the owners. And this leads us to reflect. All parents are guardians of their children\u2019s lives, not the owners, and they must help them to grow, to mature.\nThis gesture emphasizes that God alone is the Lord of individual and family history; everything comes to us from him. Each family is called to acknowledge this primacy, by protecting and educating children to open themselves to God who is the very source of life. From here passes the secret of inner youth, paradoxically witnessed to in the Gospel by an elderly couple, Simeon and Anna. The elderly Simeon, in particular, inspired by the Holy Spirit, says in regard to the Child Jesus: \u201cthis child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against [...] that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed\u201d (vv. 34-35).\nThese prophetic words reveal that Jesus has come to tear down the false images that we make of God and also of ourselves; to \u201cspeak against\u201d the worldly certainties on which we insistently rely; to make ourselves \u201crise\u201d to a true human and Christian journey, founded on the values of the Gospel.

            "Let us look at Simeon and Anna: although they were advanced in years, they did not spend their days mourning a past that never comes back, but instead embraced the future opening up before them. Brothers and sisters, let us not waste today by looking back at yesterday, or dreaming of a tomorrow that will never come; instead, let us place ourselves before the Lord in adoration and ask for eyes to see goodness and to discern the ways of God. The Lord will give them to us, if we ask him. With joy, with courage, without fear. (\u2026) Simeon took Jesus into his arms (cf. v. 28). It is a touching scene, full of meaning and unique in the Gospels. God has placed his Son in our arms too, because embracing Jesus is the essential thing, the very heart of faith. Sometimes we risk losing our bearings, getting caught up in a thousand different things, obsessing about minor issues or plunging into new projects, yet the heart of everything is Christ, embracing him as the Lord of our lives.

When one is old, one is no longer in control of one\u2019s body. One has to learn to choose what to do and what not to do. The vigour of the body fails and abandons us, even though our heart does not stop yearning. One must then learn to purify desire: be patient, choose what to ask of the body and of life. (\u2026) And the special gentleness of Jesus, who touched her hand and gently leaned over her, clearly shows, from the very beginning, his special sensitivity towards the weak and the sick, which the Son of God had certainly learned from his Mother.

The healing of Peter\u2019s mother-in-law is the first physical healing narrated by Mark: the woman is in bed with a fever; Jesus\u2019 attitude and gesture toward her are emblematic: \u201che came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up\u201d (v. 31), the Evangelist notes. There is so much tenderness in this simple act, which seems almost natural: \u201cthe fever left her; and she served them\u201d (ibid.).

(\u2026) Bending down to lift up the other. Let us not forget that the only legitimate way to look at a person from the top down is when you stretch out a hand to help them get up. The only one. And this is the mission that Jesus entrusted to the Church. The Son of God manifests his Lordship not \u201cfrom the top down\u201d, not from a distance, but in bending down, stretching out his hand; he manifests his Lordship in closeness, in tenderness, in compassion. Closeness, tenderness, compassion are the style of God. (\u2026) Today\u2019s Gospel passage also reminds us that this compassion is deeply rooted in the intimate relationship with the Father. Why? Before daybreak and after sundown, Jesus withdrew and remained alone to pray (v. 35). From there he drew the strength to fulfil his mission, preaching and healing. (Angelus, 7 February 2021)"

This woman\u2019s faith is not fraught with theological gallantry, but with insistence \u2014 she knocks at the door, knocks, knocks. Her faith is not made up of words, but of prayer. And God does not resist when he is prayed to. This is why he said, \u201cAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you\u201d.

Even the most basic human relationships can sometimes create realities incapable of reciprocal openness: the couple closed in, the family closed in, the parish closed in, the country closed in.

Thus, we must hope that the Lord give us grace and accompany us with this courage and, if we are deceived through our weakness, that in temptation he give us the courage to get up and go forward: this is why Jesus came, for this!.

It is interior deafness, which is worse than physical deafness, because it is the deafness of the heart.

First and foremost the healing from illness and from physical suffering, in order to restore bodily health; even though this aim is not completely achievable on the earthly plane, despite the many efforts of science and medicine. But there is a second, perhaps more difficult healing, and it is healing from fear. Healing from the fear that impels us to marginalize the sick, to marginalize the suffering, the disabled. And there are many ways to marginalize, even by showing pseudo compassion or by ignoring the problem; we remain deaf and dumb to the suffering of people marked by illness, anguish and difficulty.

The Apostle tells us that sin does not come from God but from our passions, from our inner weaknesses, from the wounds that original sin has left within us. That is where temptation comes from. It is interesting to note that temptation has three characteristics: it grows, infects and justifies itself.\nTemptation closes every horizon and in this way leads us to sin. When we are being tempted, only the Word of God, the Word of Jesus, can save us. Listening to His Word opens horizons, because he is always ready to help us escape from temptations. Jesus is great because not only does he help us to get out of temptation, but he also gives us enough faith.\nLet us ask the Lord to always say to us, in times of temptation, as He did with the disciples, with patience: Stop. Do not worry. Lift up your eyes, look to the horizon. Do not close yourself in, move forward. His Word will save us from falling into sin in moments of temptation\". (Santa Marta, 18 February 2014)",
            "Jesus tells us to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. That leaven is hypocrisy.\nHypocrisy is an internal division, you say one thing and do another. It is a sort of spiritual schizophrenia. Furthermore a hypocrite is a phoney: he seems good, courteous but he has a dagger behind him. A hypocrite is two-faced. He is a phoney. Jesus, speaking of these doctors of the law, affirms that they say but do not do. This is another form of hypocrisy, it is existential nominalism: those who believe that, by saying things, everything is in order. No, things must be done, not just said. On the contrary, a hypocrite is a nominalist, he believes that everything is done with words. Moreover, a hypocrite is incapable of blaming himself: he never finds a smudge on himself; he blames others. Just think of the speck and the log: this is precisely how we can describe this leaven which is hypocrisy.\nMay the Lord give to us, to all of us, the Holy Spirit and the grace of the clarity to tell ourselves what is the leaven I grow with, which is the leaven I act with. Am I a just and transparent person or am I a hypocrite? (Santa Marta, 14 October 2016)",

The other people are Christian: we should be Christian because there are even hypocritical Christians who do not accept the Holy Spirit\u2019s leaven. So, Jesus warns: \u201cBeware of the leaven of the Pharisees\u201d. The leaven of Christians is the Holy Spirit, who pushes us out, who makes us grow with all the difficulties on the way, even with all our sins, but always with hope.

And each of us must do so with an open heart, with a missionary attitude; our prayer must not be limited only to our needs, to our necessities: a prayer is truly Christian if it also has a universal dimension. (\u2026) And how does this passage end? The 72 \u201creturned with joy\u201d.

A hardened heart leads to quarrels, to wars, to selfishness and the destruction of the brother and sister because there is no compassion.  The  greatest message of salvation is that God has had compassion on us.  And the Gospel often repeats that Jesus had compassion on seeing a person or a painful situation. \u201cJesus is the compassion of the Father,\u201d. \u201cJesus is the slap to every hardness of heart.\u201d Every one of us, has something that has hardened within our hearts.  \u201cLet us remember and let it be the Lord who gives us a righteous and sincere heart where the Lord dwells.\u201d  \u201cThe Lord cannot enter hardened and ideological hearts.

The Church is not a community of perfect people, but of disciples on a journey, who follow the Lord because they know they are sinners and in need of his pardon. Thus, Christian life is a school of humility which opens us to grace. (\u2026) Jesus presents himself as a good physician! He proclaims the Kingdom of God, and the signs of its coming are clear: He heals people from disease, frees them from fear, from death, and from the devil. Before Jesus, no sinner is excluded \u2014 no sinner is excluded! Because the healing power of God knows no infirmity that cannot be healed; and this must give us confidence and open our heart to the Lord, that he may come and heal us. (General Audience, 13 April 2016)",
            "By calling Matthew, Jesus shows sinners that he does not look at their past, at their social status, at external conventions, but rather, he opens a new future to them. I once heard a beautiful saying: \u201cThere is no saint without a past nor a sinner without a future\u201d. This is what Jesus does. There is no saint without a past nor a sinner without a future. It is enough to respond to the call with a humble and sincere heart. The Church is not a community of perfect people, but of disciples on a journey, who follow the Lord because they know they are sinners and in need of his pardon. Thus, Christian life is a school of humility which opens us to grace. Such behaviour is not understood by those who have the arrogance to believe they are \u201cjust\u201d and to believe they are better than others. Hubris and pride do not allow one to recognize him or herself as in need of salvation, but rather prevent one from seeing the merciful face of God and from acting with mercy. They are a barrier. Hubris and pride are a barrier that prevents a relationship with God. Yet, this is precisely Jesus\u2019 mission: coming in search of each of us, in order to heal our wounds and to call us to follow him with love. (General audience, 13 April 2016)"

            "\"Today is the First Sunday of this Liturgical Season which refers to the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert, after his Baptism in the River Jordan. (\u2026) In these 40 days of solitude, he confronts Satan 'body to body', He unmasks his temptations and conquers him. The Church reminds us of that mystery at the beginning of Lent, so that it may give us the perspective and the meaning of this Time, which is a time of combat. Lent is a time of combat! A spiritual combat against the spirit of evil (cf. Collective Prayer for Ash Wednesday). (\u2026) This is the meaning of this First Sunday of Lent: to place ourselves decisively on the path of Jesus, the road that leads to life. (\u2026) Now let us enter into the desert without fear, because we are not alone: we are with Jesus, with the Father and with the Holy Spirit. In fact, as it was for Jesus, it is the Holy Spirit who guides us on the Lenten journey; that same Spirit who descended upon Jesus, has been given to us in Baptism\". (Angelus, February 22, 2015)",
            "On this First Sunday of Lent, the Gospel recalls the themes of temptation, conversion and the Good News. Mark the Evangelist writes: \u201cThe Spirit immediately drove Jesus out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan\u201d (cf. Mk 1:12-13). Jesus goes into the desert to prepare Himself for His mission in the world. For us too, Lent is a time of spiritual \u201ccontest\u201d, of spiritual struggle: we are called to confront the Evil One through prayer in order to be able, with God\u2019s help, to overcome him in our daily life. We know that evil unfortunately is at work in our existence and around us, where there is violence, rejection of the other, closure, war, injustice. These are all works of the Evil One. Immediately following the temptations in the desert, Jesus begins to preach the Gospel, that is, the Good News. And this Good News demands our conversion \u2014 every single day \u2014 and the Church invites us to pray for this. In fact, we are never sufficiently orientated towards God and we must continually direct our minds and our hearts towards Him. (Angelus, 18 February 2018)",
            "Every year, at the beginning of Lent, this Gospel of the temptations of Jesus in the desert reminds us that the life of the Christian, in the footsteps of the Lord, is a battle against the spirit of evil. It shows us that Jesus willingly faced the Tempter, and defeated him; and at the same time it reminds us that the devil is granted the possibility of acting on us too, with his temptations. We must be aware of the presence of this astute enemy, who seeks our eternal condemnation, our failure, and prepare to defend ourselves against him and to combat him. The grace of God assures us, with faith, prayer and penance, of our victory over the enemy. But I would like to underline one thing: in the temptations, Jesus never enters into dialogue with the devil, never. In his life Jesus never had a dialogue with the devil, never. Either He banishes him from the possessed or He condemns him, or He shows his malice, but never a dialogue. And in the desert it seems that there is a dialogue because the devil makes three proposals and Jesus responds. But Jesus does not respond with his words. He answers with the Word of God, with three passages of Scripture. And we should also all do this. When the seducer approaches, he begins to seduce us: \u201cBut think of this, do that\u2026\", the temptation is to dialogue with him, as Eve did. And if we enter into dialogue with the devil we will be defeated. Keep this in your mind and in your heart: you can never enter into dialogue with the devil, no dialogue is possible. Only the Word of God. (Angelus, 21 February 2021)"

We remember the victims of war and violence; the many \u201clittle ones\u201d of the world, crushed by hunger and poverty; we remember the anonymous who rest in the communal ossuary.

People who pass by, who move on in life without noticing the needs of others, without seeing many spiritual and material needs, are people who pass by without living, they are people who do not need others.

The lesson of Jesus that we have heard does not allow escape routes: I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was naked, displaced, sick, in prison and you assisted me (Mt 25:35-36). You cannot stonewall a person who is hungry: he must be fed. Jesus tells us this! The works of mercy are not theoretical ideas, but concrete testimonies. They oblige us to roll up our sleeves to alleviate suffering. (Jubilee audience, 30 June 2016)"

If anything, prayer begins with life itself. Prayer, Jesus teaches us, does not begin in human life after the stomach is full: rather, it settles in wherever a person is, anyone who is hungry, who weeps, who struggles, who suffers and who wonders \u2018why?\u2019. (\u2026) In prayer, Jesus does not seek to extinguish the person (\u2026) He does not want us to tone down the demands and requests, learning to bear all things. Instead, he wants all suffering, all distress to soar heavenward and become dialogue. (General Audience, 12 December 2018)",

The first three have at the centre \u2018Thou/You\u2019 addressed to God the Father; the other four have at the centre \u2018us\u2019 and our human needs. In the first part Jesus lets us enter his wishes, everyone turning to the Father: \u201challowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done\u201d; in the second it is He who enters us and becomes the interpreter of our needs: daily bread, forgiveness of sins, help in temptation and liberation from evil.\nHerein lies the matrix of every Christian prayer \u2014 I would say of every human prayer \u2014 which is always done, on the one hand, as a contemplation of God, of his mystery, of his beauty and goodness, and on the other, as a sincere and courageous request for what we need for life, and to live properly.

            "To respond to that question which we all hear in our hearts \u2014 Who is Jesus for us? \u2014 what we have learned and studied in the Catechism does not suffice. Certainly, it is important to study and to know it, but it is not enough. For, in order to know him truly, we need to travel the path that Peter travelled (\u2026). At a certain point Peter denied Jesus, he betrayed Jesus. That is when he learned the difficult science \u2014 which is more wisdom than science \u2014 of tears, of weeping.(\u2026) The question posed to Peter \u2014 Who am I for you? \u2014 within the context of a long journey, after having travelled a long path. A path of grace and of sin. It is the disciple\u2019s path. In fact, following Jesus enables us to know Jesus. To follow Jesus through our virtues and also through our sins. Always following Jesus!. What is needed is not a study of notions but rather a life as a disciple. (\u2026) Looking at Jesus, Peter and the other apostles, let us in our hearts ask this question: 'Who am I for you?\u2019. As disciples, let us ask the Father to grant us a deeper knowledge of Christ, and let us ask the Holy Spirit to explain to us this mystery. (Santa Marta, Feb 20, 2014)",
            "In Paul the Christian community finds its model, in the conviction that the Lord\u2019s presence makes apostolic work and the work of evangelization effective. The experience of the Apostle of the people reminds us that we must be committed in pastoral and missionary activities, on the one hand, as if the result depends on our efforts, with the spirit of sacrifice of an athlete, who never stops even in the face of challenges; on the other, however, knowing that the true success of our mission is a gift of Grace: it is the Holy Spirit who makes the Church\u2019s mission in the world effective. (Angelus, Oct 23, 2016)",
            "Before asking them, the Twelve, directly, Jesus wants to hear from them what the people think about him, and he is well aware that the disciples are very sensitive to the Teacher\u2019s renown! Therefore, he asks: \u201cWho do men say that I am?\u201d (v. 27). But, in reality, he is not interested in the opinions and gossip of the people. The Lord wants his disciples of yesterday and today to establish a personal relationship with him, and thus to embrace him at the centre of their life. For this reason he spurs them to face themselves honestly, and he asks: \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d (v. 29). Today, Jesus addresses this very direct and confidential question to each of us: \u201cYou, who do you say that I am? All of you, who do you say that I am? Who am I for you?\u201d. Each person is called to respond, in his or her heart, allowing each one to be illuminated by the light that the Father gives us in order to know his Son Jesus. Brothers and sisters, the profession of faith in Jesus Christ cannot stop at words, but calls to be authenticated by practical choices and gestures, by a life characterized by God\u2019s love; it calls for a great life, a life with an abundance of love for neighbour. (Angelus, 16 September 2018)",
            "With us too, today, Jesus wants to continue building his Church, this house with solid foundations but where cracks are not lacking, and which is in constant need of repair. Always. The Church always needs to be reformed, repaired. We certainly do not feel like rocks, but only like small stones. However, no small stone is useless; indeed, in Jesus\u2019 hands the smallest stone becomes precious, because he picks it up, gazes at it with great tenderness, fashions it with his Spirit, and positions it in the right place that he had always had in mind and where it can be more useful to the whole structure. (Angelus, 27 August 2017)",
            "Therefore we come to know Jesus as disciples on the path of life, following behind him. But this \u201cis not enough\u201d. In reality, this is a work of the Holy Spirit, who is a great worker. And he is always at work in us: and he carries out this great work of explaining the mystery of Jesus, and of giving us the mind of Christ. We look at Jesus, Peter, the apostles and we hear in our hearts this question: Who am I for you? As disciples, let us ask the Father to grant us a deeper knowledge of Christ, and let us ask the Holy Spirit to explain to us this mystery. (Santa Marta, 20 Feb 2014)",
            "Today, we hear Jesus\u2019 question directed to each one of us: \u201cAnd you, who do you say I am?\u201d To each one of us. And each one of us must give not a theoretical answer, but one that involves faith, that is, life, because faith is life! \u201cFor me you are \u2026\u201d and then to confess Jesus. An answer that demands from us too, as from the first disciples, inward listening to the voice of the Father and consonance with what the Church, gathered around Peter, continues to proclaim. It is a matter of understanding who Christ is for us: whether He is the centre of our life, whether He is the goal of our commitment in the Church, of our commitment in society. Who is Jesus Christ for me? Who is Jesus Christ for you, for you, for you \u2026? An answer that we should give every day. (Angelus, 23 August 2020)",
            "Let us think about how many times the Lord has heard our prayer and sent us an angel? An angel who unexpectedly comes to pull us out of a difficult situation. Who comes to snatch us from the hands of death and from the evil one; who points out the wrong path; who rekindles in us the flame of hope; who gives us tender comfort; who consoles our broken hearts; who awakens us from our slumber to the world; or who simply tells us, \u201cYou are not alone\u201d. (Saints Peter and Paul, 29 June 2015)",
            "Today, we hear Jesus\u2019 question directed to each one of us: \u2018And you, who do you say I am?\u2019. To each one of us.

            "How many forces in the course of history have tried, and still do, to destroy the Church, from without as well as within, but they themselves are destroyed and the Church remains alive and fruitful! She remains inexplicably solid (\u2026) Everything passes, only God remains. Indeed, kingdoms, peoples, cultures, nations, ideologies, powers have passed, but the Church, founded on Christ, notwithstanding the many storms and our many sins, remains ever faithful to the deposit of faith shown in service; for the Church does not belong to Popes, bishops, priests, nor the lay faithful; the Church in every moment belongs solely to Christ. (Homily, 29 June 2015)",
            "Two great Apostles of the Gospel and two pillars of the Church: Peter and Paul.  Today we celebrate their memory. Let us take a closer look at these two witnesses of faith. At the heart of their story is not their own gifts and abilities; at the centre is the encounter with Christ that changed their lives. They experienced a love that healed them and set them free. They then became apostles and ministers of freedom for others. Peter, the fisherman from Galilee, was set free above all from his sense of inadequacy and his bitter experience of failure, thanks to the unconditional love of Jesus. (\u2026) The Apostle Paul also experienced the freedom brought by Christ. He was set free from the most oppressive form of slavery, which is slavery to self. From Saul, the name of the first king of Israel, he became Paul, which means \u201csmall\u201d. (\u2026) Dear brothers and sisters, the Church looks to these two giants of faith and sees two Apostles who set free the power of the Gospel in our world, only because first they themselves had been set free by their encounter with Christ. (Homily, 29 June 2021)",
            "\u201cWho do men say that the Son of man is?\u201d (v. 13). It is a question we too can ask ourselves: what do people say about Jesus? In general, good things. Many see him as a great teacher, as a special person: good, righteous, consistent, courageous\u2026 But is this enough to understand who He is, and above all, is it enough for Jesus? It seems not. If He were simply a person from the past \u2014 just as the figures cited in the same Gospel, John the Baptist, Moses, Elijah and the great prophets were for the people \u2014 He would merely be a good memory of a bygone time. And for Jesus, this will not do. Therefore, immediately afterwards, the Lord asks the disciples the decisive question: \u201cBut who do you \u2014 you! \u2014 say that I am?\u201d (v. 15). Who am I for you, now? Jesus does not want to be a key figure from the past; He wants to be an important person for you today, of my today; not a distant prophet: Jesus wants to be the God who is close to us!\nChrist, brothers and sisters, is not a memory of the past, but the God of the present. If He were merely an historical figure, to imitate Him today would be impossible: we would find ourselves faced with the great chasm of time, and above all, faced with his example, which is like a very high, unscalable mountain; we want to climb it, but lack the ability and the necessary means. Instead, Jesus is alive: let us remember this. Jesus is alive, Jesus lives in the Church, He lives in the world, Jesus accompanies us, Jesus is by our side, He offers us His Word, He offers us His grace, which enlighten and refresh us on the journey.

            "(\u2026)This is the healthy realism of the Catholic Church: the Catholic Church never teaches \u2018either this, or this\u2019. Rather, the Church says: this and this. In short, \u201cstrive for perfection: reconcile yourself with your brother, do not insult him, love him, but should you have any problem at least put yourself in agreement, so as to avoid war. This is the healthy realism of Catholicism.(\u2026) Allow me to share a term with you which might seem a bit strange, it is the little holiness of negotiation: I cannot do everything, but I want to do everything, I am going to agree with you, at least let us not insult one another, let us not make war and let us live together in peace. Jesus is great, and he frees us from all of our miseries, even from that idealism that is not Catholic. Therefore, let us ask the Lord to teach us, first, to leave all rigidity, but to go upwards, to be able to adore and praise God; that He may teach us to be reconciled with one another; and also, that He may teach us to agree with each other to the extent that we can. (Santa Marta, June 9, 2106)",
            "What had been said in the ancient covenant was true, but that was not all: Jesus came to bring to fulfillment and to promulgate in a definitive way the Law of God, up to the last iota. He manifests its original aims and fulfils its authentic aspects, and he does all this through his preaching and, even more, with the offering of himself on the Cross. In this way, Jesus teaches how to fully carry out God\u2019s will, and he uses these words: with a \u2018righteousness\u2019 that \u2018exceeds\u2019 that of the scribes and the Pharisees (cf. v. 20). A righteousness enlivened by love, charity, mercy, and hence capable of fulfilling the substance of the commandments, avoiding the risk of formalism. (\u2026)May the Virgin Mary, a woman of listening and joyful obedience, help us to draw ever closer to the Gospel, to be Christians not \u2018of fa\u00e7ade\u2019, but of substance! This is possible with the grace of the Holy Spirit, who allows us to do everything with love, and thus to wholly fulfil the will of God. (Angelus, Feb 12, 2017)",
            "Do not talk to the Father without being at peace with your brother. Three criteria: a criterion of realism; a criterion of coherence, meaning not to kill and not even to insult, because those who insult kill; and a criterion of fraternity rooted in sonship. One cannot talk to the Father if one cannot even speak to one\u2019s brother \u2013 and this means overcoming the holier-than-thou attitude of the scribes and the Pharisees. This program is not easy, is it? Though, it is the way that Jesus tells us to keep going. Let us ask Him for the grace to move forward in peace among ourselves, with compromises, and always with coherence and in a spirit of fraternity rooted in sonship. (Santa Marta, 12 June 2014)",
            "How many times do we in the Church hear these things: how many times! \u2018But that priest, that man or that woman from the Catholic Action, that bishop, or that Pope tell us we must do this this way!\u2019 and then they do the opposite. This is the scandal that wounds the people and prevents the people of God from growing and going forward. It doesn\u2019t free them. \u2018Strive for perfectionism: reconcile with your brother. Do not insult him. Love him. And if there is a problem, at the very least settle your differences so that war doesn\u2019t break out.\u2019 Jesus always knows how to accompany us, he gives us the ideal, he accompanies us towards the ideal, He frees us from the chains of the laws' rigidity and tells us: \u2018But do that up to the point that you are capable.\u2019 And allow me to use this word that seems a bit strange: it\u2019s the tiny sanctity of negotiationsLet us implore our Lord to teach us, first to escape from all rigidity but also to go out beyond ourselves, so we can adore and praise God who teaches us to be reconciled amongst ourselves and who also teaches us to reach an agreement up to the point that we are able to do so. (Santa Marta, 9 June 2016)",
            "Love of neighbour is a fundamental attitude that Jesus speaks of, and he says that our relationship with God cannot be honest if we are not willing to make peace with our neighbour. He says: \u201cSo if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift\u201d. Therefore we are called to reconcile with our neighbour before showing our devotion to the Lord in prayer. (Angelus, 16 February 2014)",

While all this is good, \u201clet us be careful: this is not to \u2018pay\u2019 for the grace or to \u2018purchase\u2019 the grace; this is to expand your heart so that grace may be granted\u201d. Grace is free. With regard to spiritual life, there is always the danger of slipping into the idea of payments, even when speaking with the Lord, as if we wished to bribe the Lord. No! The Lord\u2019s grace is free and you must give it freely. May our life of holiness be this expansion of the heart so that the gratuitousness of God, God\u2019s grace ... may reach our heart\u201d. (Santa Marta, 11 June 2019)",
            "In all of this we see that Jesus does not give importance simply to disciplinary compliance and exterior conduct. He goes to the Law\u2019s roots focusing, first and foremost, on the intention and the human heart, out of which our good and bad actions originate. To obtain good and honest conduct, legal rules are not enough. We need a deep motivation, an expression of a hidden wisdom, God\u2019s wisdom, which can be received through the Holy Spirit. Through faith in Christ, we can open ourselves to the action of the Spirit which enables us to experience divine love. (Angelus, 16 February 2014)",
            "Often we believe that our sins distance the Lord from us. In reality, in sinning, we may distance ourselves from him, but, seeing us in danger, he tries all the harder to find us. God never gives in to the possibility that a person could stay estranged from his love, provided, however, that he find in him or her some sign of repentance for the evil done. The experience of reconciliation to God allows us to discover the necessity of other forms of reconciliation: in families, in interpersonal relationships, in ecclesial communities, as well as in social international relations. Reconciliation is also a service to peace, solidarity and the welcome of all. (Jubilee Audience, 30 April 2016)",
            "Jesus reminds us that words can kill! When we say that a person has the tongue of a snake, what does that mean? That their words kill! Not only is it wrong to take the life of another, but it is also wrong to bestow the poison of anger upon him, strike him with slander, and speak ill of him. Love of neighbour is a fundamental attitude that Jesus speaks of, and he says that our relationship with God cannot be honest if we are not willing to make peace with our neighbour. (Angelus, 16 February 2014)",
            "The Scriptures speak of the suffering of the poor and oppressed which God knows and shares. But the hunger and thirst for righteousness\u2019 sake that the Lord refers to is even more profound than the legitimate need for human justice that each man and woman carries in his/her heart. This is the righteousness that comes from God (cf. 1 Cor 1:30). Saint Augustine says: \u201cThou madest us for Thyself, Lord, and our heart is restless, until it rests in Thee\u201d. There is an interior thirst, an inner hunger, an anxiety.... This is why the Church is sent forth to proclaim to all the Word of God, imbued with the Holy Spirit. Because the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the greatest righteousness that can be offered to the heart of humanity which has a vital need for it, even though it does not realize this.  May the Lord grant us this grace: to have this thirst for righteousness which is the very desire to find him, to see God and to do good unto others. (General Audience 11 March 2020)",
            "Love of neighbour is a fundamental attitude that Jesus speaks of, and he says that our relationship with God cannot be honest if we are not willing to make peace with our neighbour.

            "To give us a concrete example, Jesus concentrates on the \u201crite of the offertory\u201d. By making an offering to God, one reciprocated the gratuity of his gifts. It was a very important rite \u2014 making an offering to reciprocate symbolically, let\u2019s say, the gratuitousness of his gifts \u2014 so important that to interrupt it was forbidden other than for serious reasons. But Jesus states that it must be interrupted if a brother has something against us, in order to go and be reconciled with him first (cf. vv. 23-24): only in this way is the rite fulfilled. (\u2026) In this way there is fulfilment in God\u2019s eyes; otherwise, external, purely ritualistic observance is pointless, it becomes a pretence. In other words, Jesus makes us understand that religious rules are necessary, they are good, but they are only the beginning: to fulfil them, it is necessary to go beyond the letter and live their meaning. The commandments that God gave us should not be locked up in the airless vaults of formal observance; otherwise, we are limited to an exterior, detached religiosity, servants of \u201cGod the master\u201d rather than children of \u201cGod the Father\u201d. Jesus wants this: not to have the idea of serving a God who is master, but Father; and this is why it is necessary to go beyond the letter. (Angelus, 12 February 2023)"

When he tells me to love my enemies, he wants to give me the capacity to do so. Without that ability, we would not be able, but he tells you to \u201clove your enemy\u201d and gives you the capacity to love.

What should we ask of him? What is God happy to give us? The strength to love, which is not a thing, but rather the Holy Spirit.

Do not worry about the malice of others, about those who think ill of you. Instead, begin to disarm your heart out of love for Jesus. For those who love God have no enemies in their hearts. The worship of God is contrary to the culture of hatred. And the culture of hatred is fought by combatting the cult of complaint. How many times do we complain about the things that we lack, about the things that go wrong! Jesus knows about all the things that don\u2019t work.

You may well say: \u201cBut Jesus goes too far! He even says: \u201cLove your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\u201d (Mt 5:44). Surely he speaks like this to gain people\u2019s attention, but he cannot really mean it\u201d. But he really does. Here Jesus is not speaking in paradoxes or using nice turns of phrase.

How many times have we neglected that demand, behaving like everyone else! Yet his commandment of love is not simply a challenge; it is the very heart of the Gospel. Where the command of universal love is concerned, let us not accept excuses or preach prudent caution. The Lord was not cautious; he did not yield to compromises. He asks of us the extremism of charity. This is the only legitimate kind of Christian extremism: the extremism of love. (Homily, Bari, 23 February 2020)",

He is the fulfillment of revelation; that is why beside Him appear transfigured, Moses and Elijah appear; they represent the Law and the Prophets, so as to signify that everything finishes and begins in Jesus, in his passion and in his glory. Their instructions for the disciples and for us is this: Listen to Him!. Listen to Jesus. He is the Saviour: follow Him. To listen to Christ, in fact, entails taking up the logic of his Pascal Mystery, setting out on the journey with Him to make of oneself a gift of love to others, in docile obedience to the will of God, with an attitude of detachment from worldly things and of interior freedom.(\u2026) (Angelus, II Sunday of Lent, March 1, 2015)",
            "The event of the Lord\u2019s Transfiguration offers us a message of hope \u2014 thus shall we be, with Him \u2014: it invites us to encounter Jesus, to be at the service of our brothers and sisters. The disciples\u2019 ascent up Mount Tabor leads us to reflect on the importance of disengaging from worldly matters, in order to make a journey toward heaven and to contemplate Jesus. In this perspective, the summer season is a providential time to cultivate our task of seeking and encountering the Lord. Transformed by Christ\u2019s presence and by the ardour of his Word, we will be a concrete sign of the invigorating love of God for all our brothers and sisters, especially for those who are suffering, for those who are lonely and neglected, for the sick and for the multitude of men and women who, in different parts of the world, are humiliated by injustice, abuse and violence. May our Mother and the Mother of God help us to be in harmony with the Word of God, so that Christ may become light and lodestar throughout our life. (Angelus, August 6, 2017)",
            "The Transfiguration of Christ shows us the Christian perspective of suffering. Suffering is not sadomasochism: it is a necessary but transitory passage. The point of arrival to which we are called is luminous like the face of Christ transfigured: in Him is salvation, beatitude, light and the boundless love of God. By revealing His glory in this way, Jesus ensures that the cross, trials, the difficulties with which we struggle, are resolved and overcome in Easter. Thus this Lent, let us also go up the mountain with Jesus! But in what way? With prayer. Let us climb the mountain with prayer: silent prayer, the prayer of the heart, a prayer that always seeks the Lord. Let us pause for some time in reflection a little each day, let us fix our inner gaze on His countenance and allow His light to permeate us and shine in our life. (Angelus, 17 March 2019)",

(Angelus, 6 August 2017)",
            "Jesus climbs up with the three disciples and they stop at the top of the mountain. Here, he is transfigured before them. His face radiant and his garments glistening, which provide a preview of the image as the Risen One, offer to those frightened men the light, the light of hope, the light to pass through the shadows: death will not be the end of everything, because it will open to the glory of the Resurrection. Thus, Jesus announces his death; he takes them up the mountain and shows them what will happen afterwards, the Resurrection. As the Apostle Peter exclaimed (cf. v. 5), it is good to pause with the Lord on the mountain, to live this \u201cpreview\u201d of light in the heart of Lent. It is a call to remember, especially when we go through a difficult trial \u2014 and many of you know what it means to go through a difficult trial \u2014 that the Lord is Risen and does not allow darkness to have the last word. (\u2026) Let us be careful, however: that feeling of Peter that \u201cit is well that we are here\u201d must not become spiritual laziness. (\u2026) We are called to experience the encounter with Christ so that, enlightened by his light, we might take it and make it shine everywhere. Igniting little lights in people\u2019s hearts; being little lamps of the Gospel that bear a bit of love and hope: this is the mission of a Christian. (Angelus, 28 February 2021)",
            "Jesus\u2019 love is without measure: it is love, and he chooses with that plan of love. It is a free, unconditional choice, a free initiative, a divine friendship that asks for nothing in return. And just as he called those three disciples, so today too he calls some to be close to him, to be able to bear witness. To be witnesses to Jesus is a gift we have not deserved; we may feel inadequate but we cannot back out with the excuse of our incapacity.\nWe have not been on Mount Tabor, we have not seen with our own eyes the face of Jesus shining like the sun. However, we too were given the Word of Salvation, faith was given to us, and we have experienced the joy of meeting Jesus in different ways. Jesus also says to us: \u201cRise, and have no fear\u201d (Mt 17:7). In this world, marked by selfishness and greed, the light of God is obscured by the worries of everyday life. We often say: I do not have time to pray, I am unable to carry out a service in the parish, to respond to the requests of others.... But we must not forget that the Baptism and Confirmation we have received has made us witnesses, not because of our ability, but as a result of the gift of the Spirit. (Angelus, 8 March 2020)"

Therefore, when we want to say: he does this, or she does that, it is better to look in the mirror before we speak.

We ask ourselves: What does it mean for disciples to be merciful? Jesus explains this with two verbs: \u201cforgive\u201d (Lk 6:37) and \u201cgive\u201d (v. 38). Forgiveness, in fact, is the pillar that holds up the life of the Christian community, because it shows the the gratuitousness with which God has loved us first. The Christian must forgive! Why? Because he has been forgiven. Forgiveness is the first pillar; giving is the second pillar. \u201cGive, and it will be given to you.... For the measure you give will be the measure you get back\u201d. Merciful love is therefore the only way forward.

The devil has two styles: seduction, with worldly promises, as he wanted to do with Jesus in the desert, to seduce him, and with seduction to make him change the plan of redemption; and, if this does not work, doggedness. The devil has no half measures. His pride is so great that he tries to destroy. He destroys enjoying the destruction with dogged fury. (\u2026) May the Lord give us the grace to know how to discern when the spirit that wants to destroy us with doggedness is present, and when the same spirit wants to console us with the appearances of the world, with vanity. But let us not forget: when there is dogged fury, there is hatred, the vengeance of the defeated devil. This is how it is until today, in the Church. Think of so many Christians, how cruelly persecuted they are.

Lazarus is a good example of the silent cry of the poor throughout the ages and the contradictions of a world in which immense wealth and resources are in the hands of the few.

            "Lazarus, with his needs and his miseries, his disease, was actually the Lord who was knocking at the door, so that this man would open his heart and mercy could enter.

(Santa Marta, 25 February 2016)",
            "To ignore a poor man is to scorn God! We must learn this well: to ignore the poor is to scorn God. There is a detail in the parable that is worth noting: the rich man has no name, but only an adjective: \u2018the rich man\u2019; while the name of the poor man is repeated five times, and \u2018Lazarus\u2019 means \u2018God helps\u2019. Lazarus, who is lying at the gate, is a living reminder to the rich man to remember God, but the rich man does not receive that reminder. Hence, he will be condemned not because of his wealth, but for being incapable of feeling compassion for Lazarus and for not coming to his aid. (\u2026) The rich man knew the Word of God, but did not let it enter his heart, he did not listen to it, and thus was incapable of opening his eyes and of having compassion for the poor man. No messenger and no message can take the place of the poor whom we meet on the journey, because in them Jesus himself comes to meet us: \u201cas you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me\u201d (Mt 25:40), Jesus says. Thus hidden in the reversal of fate that the parable describes lies the mystery of our salvation, in which Christ links poverty with mercy. (General audience, 18 May 2016)"

This is the Church\u2019s behavior\u2026This widow was not important, her name did not appear in the newspapers. No one knew her. She had no degree...nothing. Nothing. She did not shine due to her own light. This is why I see the Church in this woman. Church\u2019s greatest virtue is that she does not shine due to her own light but that she reflects the light that comes from her Spouse. (Homily, Santa Marta, 24 November 2014)",
            "It is not easy to understand what humility is. It is the effect of a change that the Spirit himself brings about in us in our daily lives. Such was the case, for example, of Naaman the Syrian (cf. 2 Kings 5). In the days of the prophet Elisha, this man enjoyed great renown. He was a valiant general of the Syrian army who had on many occasions demonstrated his bravery and courage. Yet together with fame, power, esteem, honours and glory, Naaman was forced to live with a tragic situation: he had leprosy. His armour, that had won him renown, in reality covered a frail, wounded and diseased humanity. We often find this contradiction in our lives: sometimes great gifts are the armour that covers great frailties. (To the Roman Curia, 23 December 2021)",
            "It is not easy to understand what humility is. It is the effect of a change that the Spirit himself brings about in us in our daily lives. Such was the case, for example, of Naaman the Syrian (\u2026) Naaman came to understand a fundamental truth: we cannot spend our lives hiding behind armour, a role we play, or social recognition; in the end, it hurts us. The moment comes in each individual\u2019s life when he or she desires to set aside the glitter of this world\u2019s glory for the fullness of an authentic life, with no further need for armour or masks. (\u2026) Laden with silver and gold, Naaman set out on his journey and thus came to the prophet Elisha, who laid down for him, as the only condition for his healing, the simple gesture of disrobing and washing seven times in the Jordan River. Nothing to do with celebrity, honours, gold or silver! The grace that saves is free; it is not reducible to the price of this world\u2019s goods. (\u2026) A great lesson, this! The humility of exposing his own humanity, in accordance with the word of the Lord, gained healing for Naaman. (Pope Francis to the Roman Curia, 23 December 2021)",
            "Brothers and sisters, Jesus also goes the way of the prophets: he presents himself as we would not expect. He is not found by those who seek miracles \u2014 if we look for miracles, we will not find Jesus \u2014 by those who seek new sensations, intimate experiences, strange things; those who seek a faith made up of power and external signs. No, they will not find him. Instead, he is found only by those who accept his ways and his challenges, without complaint, without suspicion, without criticism and long faces. In other words, Jesus asks you to welcome him in the daily reality in which you live; in the Church of today, as it is; in those who are close to you every day; in the reality of those in need, in the problems of your family, in your parents, in your children, in grandparents, welcoming God there. He is there, inviting us to purify ourselves in the river of willingness and in many healthy baths of humility. It takes humility to encounter God, to allow ourselves to be encountered by him. And are we welcoming or do we resemble his fellow countrymen, who believed they knew everything about him? (Angelus, 30 January 2022)"

Indeed, in forgiving we open our heart for God\u2019s mercy to enter and forgive us. We all have reasons to ask God\u2019s forgiveness: Let us forgive, and we shall be forgiven. (Santa Marta, March 1, 2016)",
            "From the time of our Baptism, God has forgiven us, releasing us from an intractable debt: original sin. But that is the first time. Then, with boundless mercy, he forgives us all our faults as soon as we show even the least sign of repentance. This is how God is: merciful. When we are tempted to close our heart to those who have offended us and tell us they are sorry, let us remember our Heavenly Father\u2019s words to the wicked servant: \u201cI forgave you all that debt because you besought me; and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?\u201d (vv. 32-33).

The servant\u2019s inconsistent behaviour is the same as ours when we refuse to forgive our brothers and sisters. Whereas the king in the parable is the image of God who loves us with a love that is so rich in mercy as to welcome us, love us and forgive us continuously.

It is something different. Sin is not a simple mistake. Sin is idolatry: it is idol worship, the idol of pride, vanity, money, \u2018my self\u2019, my own \u2018well-being\u2019. We have so many.

Mt 6:12). These words contain a decisive truth. We cannot demand God\u2019s forgiveness for ourselves if we in turn do not grant forgiveness to our neighbour. It is a condition: think of your end, of God\u2019s forgiveness, and stop hating. Reject resentment, that bothersome fly that keeps coming back.

In the divine attitude justice is pervaded with mercy, whereas the human attitude is limited to justice. Jesus exhorts us to open ourselves with courage to the strength of forgiveness, because in life not everything can be resolved with justice. We know this. (\u2026) How much suffering, how many wounds, how many wars could be avoided if forgiveness and mercy were the style of our life! Even in families, even in families. How many disunited families, who do not know how to forgive each other. How many brothers and sisters bear this resentment within. It is necessary to apply merciful love to all human relationships: between spouses, between parents and children, within our communities, in the Church and also in society and politics.

The Scripture says, \u201cDo not kill\u201d, but for Jesus this is not enough if brothers and sisters are then hurt by words; the Scripture says, \u201cDo not commit adultery\u201d, but this is not enough if one then lives a love tainted by duplicity and falsehood; the Scripture says, \u201cDo not bear false witness\u201d, but it is not enough to take a solemn oath if one then acts with hypocrisy (cf. Mt 5:21-37). This is not fulfilment. (\u2026) In other words, Jesus makes us understand that religious rules are necessary, they are good, but they are only the beginning: to fulfil them, it is necessary to go beyond the letter and live their meaning. The commandments that God gave us should not be locked up in the airless vaults of formal observance otherwise, we are limited to an exterior, detached religiosity, servants of \u201cGod the master\u201d rather than children of \u201cGod the Father\u201d.

Here there is true, lethal poison: the malice with which, in a premeditated manner, one wants to destroy the good reputation of the other. May God free us from this terrible temptation! And if, by examining our conscience, we realize that this weed is sprouting within us, let us go straight away to confess it in the Sacrament of Penance, before it grows and produces its evil effects, which are incurable. Be careful, because this attitude destroys families, friendships, communities and even society. (Angelus, 10 June 2018)",
            "\u201cAnd we can ask ourselves the question: Do I guard myself, my heart, my feelings, my thoughts? Do I guard the treasure of grace? Do I guard the presence of the Holy Spirit in me? Or do I let go, feeling secure, believing that all is going well? But if you do not guard yourself, he who is stronger than you will come. But if someone stronger comes and overcomes, he takes away the weapons in which one trusted, and he shall divide the spoil. Vigilance! Three criteria! Do not confuse the truth. Jesus fights the devil: first criterion. Second criterion: he who is not with Jesus is against Jesus. There are no attitudes in the middle. Third criterion: vigilance over our hearts because the devil is astute. He is never cast out forever. It will only be so on the last day.\u201d (\u2026)  \u201cLet us ask the Lord for the grace to take these things seriously. He came to fight for our salvation. He won against the devil! Please, let us not do business with the devil! He seeks to return home, to take possession of us\u2026 Do not relativize; be vigilant! And always with Jesus!\u201d (Santa Marta, 11 October 2013)"

It is difficult, but we must begin ...

We ask this grace of Jesus, today. (Santa Marta, June 6, 2013)",
            "In effect, the visible sign a Christian can show in order to witness to his love for God to the world and to others, to his family, is the love he bears for his brothers. The Commandment to love God and neighbour is the first, not because it is at the top of the list of Commandments. Jesus does not place it at the pinnacle but at the centre, because it is from the heart that everything must go out and to which everything must return and refer. (Angelus, Oct 26, 2014)",
            "\u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and first commandment\u201d (vv. 37-38). And he could have stopped there. Yet, Jesus adds something that was not asked by the doctor of the law. He says, in fact: \u201cAnd a second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself\u201d (v. 39). And in this case too, Jesus does not invent the second commandment, but takes it from the Book of Leviticus. The novelty is in his placing these two commandments together \u2014 love for God and love for neighbour \u2014 revealing that they are in fact inseparable and complementary, two sides of the same coin. (Angelus, 26 October 2014)",
            "In choosing these two Words addressed by God to his people and by putting them together, Jesus taught once and for all that love for God and love for neighbour are inseparable; moreover, they sustain one another. Even if set in a sequence, they are two sides of a single coin: experienced together they are a believer\u2019s strength! To love God is to live of him and for him, for what he is and for what he does. Our God is unmitigated giving; he is unlimited forgiveness; he is a relationship that promotes and fosters. Therefore, to love God means to invest our energies each day to be his assistants in the unmitigated service of our neighbour, in trying to forgive without limitations, and in cultivating relationships of communion and fraternity. (Angelus, Sunday 4 November 2018)",
            "\u201cIf a newborn child could speak, he would certainly express the fact that he feels loved by his parents\u201d.  And what parents do with the child is what God did with us: He loved us first. And this gives birth to and increases our capacity to love. This is a clear definition of love: we can love God because He loved us first. (Santa Marta, 10 January 2020)",
            "This is why Jesus says: \u2018The greatest love is this: to love God with your whole life, with all your heart, with all your strength, and your neighbour as yourself\u2019. Because it is the only commandment that is at the heights of the gratuitousness of God\u2019s salvation. Then Jesus adds: \u2018All the other commandments are contained in this one because it calls \u2014 it does good to everyone \u2014 all the others\u2019. The source is love; the horizon is love. If you have closed the door and have taken away the key of love, you are not at the heights of the gratuitousness of the salvation you have received. (Homily, Santa Marta, 15 October 2015)",

At which point Jesus adds: \u201cIn this commandment are all the others, because it summons \u2014 it creates all that is good \u2014 all the others\u2019. The source is love; the horizon is love. If you have closed the door and have taken away the key of love, you are not worthy of the free salvation you have received\u201d. (Santa Marta, 15 October 2015)",
            "Jesus\u2019 response once again takes up and joins two fundamental precepts, which God gave his people through Moses. (\u2026) The first is that moral and religious life cannot be reduced to an anxious and forced obedience. There are people who seek to fulfil the commandments in an anxious or forced manner, and Jesus helps us understand that moral and religious life cannot be reduced to anxious or forced obedience, but must have love as its precept. The second principle is that love must tend together and inseparably toward God and toward neighbour. This is one of the primary innovations of Jesus\u2019 teachings, and it helps us understand that what is not expressed in love of neighbour is not true love of God; and, likewise, what is not drawn from one\u2019s relationship with God is not true love of neighbour. (Angelus, 25 October 2020)",
            "Today, therefore, let us take the example of this scribe. Let us repeat Jesus\u2019 words, making them resound in us: \u201cTo love God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind and with all our strength and my neighbour as myself\u201d. And let us ask ourselves: does this commandment truly orient my life? Does this commandment resonate in my daily life? It would be good this evening, before going to sleep, to make an examination of conscience on this Word, to see if we have loved the Lord today and if we have done a little good to those we happened to meet. May every encounter bring about a little bit of good, a little bit of love that comes from this Word. May the Virgin Mary, in whom the Word of God was made flesh, teach us to welcome the living word of the Gospel in our hearts. (Angelus, 31 October 2021)",

It is not a matter of pre-selecting my neighbour: this is not Christian. I think my neighbour is the one I have chosen ahead of time: no, this is not Christian, it is pagan; but it is about having eyes to see and a heart to want what is good for him or her. If we practice seeing with Jesus\u2019 gaze, we will always be listening and be close to those in need. (Angelus, 4 November 2018)"

And this is beautiful: to beg for the mercy of God! The tax collector shows us all, the condition that is necessary in order to receive the Lord\u2019s forgiveness. In the end, he is the one, so despised, who becomes an icon of the true believer. (General Audience, June 1, 2016)",
            "But, I ask myself: can one pray with arrogance? No. Can one pray with hypocrisy? No. We must only pray by placing ourselves before God just as we are. Not like the pharisee who prays with arrogance and hypocrisy. We are all taken up by the phrenetic pace of daily life, often at the mercy of feelings, dazed and confused. It is necessary to learn how to rediscover the path to our heart, to recover the value of intimacy and silence, because the God who encounters us and speaks to us is there. Only by beginning there can we in our turn encounter others and speak with them. (General Audience, 1 June 2016)",
            "When the Church is humble, when the Church is poor, even when the Church confesses her wretchedness \u2013 we all experience this \u2013 then the Church is faithful. The Church says: \u2018I am dark, but my light comes from there!' This does us all good. Humble. Without boasting of having our own light, always seeking the light that comes from the Lord. (Santa Marta, 24 November 2014)",
            "The parable teaches us that a man is just or sinful not because of his social class, but because of his way of relating to God and how he relates to his brothers and sisters. Gestures of repentance and the few and brief words of the tax collector bear witness to his awareness of his own miserable condition. His prayer is essential. He acts out of humility, certain only that he is a sinner in need of mercy. If the pharisee asked for nothing because he already had everything, the tax collector can only beg for the mercy of God.

            "This ability to say we are sinners opens us to the wonder of the encounter with Jesus Christ, the true encounter. Even in our parishes, in our societies, even among consecrated persons: How many people are capable of saying that Jesus is the Lord? Many! But how difficult it is to say sincerely: \u2018I am a sinner.\u2019 It is easier to say that about others, eh? When someone gossips, eh? \u2018This, that, the other thing\u2026\u2019 We all have doctorates in that, right? To come to a true encounter with Christ the two-fold confession is necessary: \u2018You are the Son of God, and I am a sinner\u2019 \u2013 not theoretically \u2013 but because of this, because of this, because of this, and because of this.\u2019 (Homily, Santa Marta, 3 September 2015)",
            "Today, then, let us ask ourselves, each one of us in our heart: how am I doing with humility? Do I seek to be recognized by others, to affirm myself and to be praised, or do I think rather about serving? Do I know how to listen, like Mary, or do I want only to speak and receive attention? Do I know how to keep silence, like Mary, or am I always chattering? Do I know how to take a step back, defuse quarrels and arguments, or do I always want to stand out? Let us think about these questions: how am I doing with humility?  In her littleness, Mary wins Heaven first. The secret of her success is precisely that she recognizes her lowliness, that she recognizes her need. With God, only those who recognize themselves as nothing can receive the all. Only those who empty themselves can be filled by him. (Angelus, 15 August 2021)",
            "We are a bit tax collectors because we are sinners, and a bit Pharisees because we are presumptuous, able to justify ourselves, masters of the art of self-justification. This may often work with ourselves, but not with God. This trick does not work with God. Let us pray for the grace to experience ourselves in need of mercy, interiorly poor. For this reason too, we do well to associate with the poor, to remind ourselves that we are poor, to remind ourselves that the salvation of God operates only in an atmosphere of interior poverty. (Homily, Conclusion of the Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region, 27 Oct 2019)",
            "It is not enough, therefore, to ask how much we pray, we have to ask ourselves how we pray, or better, in what state our heart is: it is important to examine it so as to evaluate our thoughts, our feelings, and root out arrogance and hypocrisy. But, I ask myself: can one pray with arrogance? No. Can one pray with hypocrisy? No. We must only pray by placing ourselves before God just as we are.

            "Let us confirm whether, in us, as in the Pharisee, there is the intimate presumption of being righteous (cf. v. 9) that leads us to despise others. It happens, for instance, when we seek compliments and always make a list of our own merits and good works, when we concern ourselves with how we appear rather than how we are, when we let ourselves be trapped by narcissism and exhibitionism. Let us beware of narcissism and exhibitionism, based on vainglory, that lead even us Christians, priests and bishops, always to have one word on our lips. Which word? \u201cI\u201d: \u201cI did this, I wrote that, I said it, I understood it before you\u201d, and so on. Where there is too much \u201cI\u201d, there is too little God. In my country, we call these people: \u201cme, myself and I\u201d, this is the name of those people. Once the people used to talk about a priest who was like that, self-centred, and they, jokingly, used to say, \u201cWhen he incenses, he does it backwards, he incenses himself\u201d.

Faith, perseverance and courage.

We become distant \u201cfrom the living God\u201d. Turning our backs hardens our hearts. And when we do not listen, the heart becomes harder, more closed within itself, hard and incapable of receiving anything (\u2026) we risk becoming \u201c\u2018unfaithful\u2019 Catholics, \u2018pagan\u2019 Catholics, or even worse, \u2018atheist\u2019 Catholics, because we have no loving reference to the Living God\u201d.

And they all asked themselves: With what authority do you come to teach us? Where did you study?. In a word, it is always the same attitude: they disqualify the Lord, they disqualify the prophet in order to take away his authority. (Santa Marta, 4 April 2014)",

There are two things to be done: to dialogue with these people is not possible because they have their own ideas, fixed ideas, which the devil has sown in their hearts. We have heard what their plan of action is. What can one do? What Jesus did: remain silent. It is striking when we read in the Gospel that before all of these accusations, to all these things, Jesus was silent. In the face of the hounding spirit, only silence, never justification. Jesus spoke, He explained. When He understood that there were no words, silence. And in silence, Jesus lived His passion. It is the silence of the just one in the face of dogged fury. This is valid even for \u2013 we can say \u2013 the little, everyday types of hounding, when someone thinks someone might be talking behind his or her back, they say things and then nothing comes out in the open\u2026 stay silent. Silence. Endure and tolerate the hounding of gossip. Gossip is even a form of hounding, social hounding. It is a type of hounding that is not as strong as this, but it is hounding to destroy the other because the person is a disturbance, a nuisance.\nLet us ask the Lord for the grace to fight against the evil spirit, to dialogue when we need to dialogue, but before the spirit of hounding, to have the courage to remain silent and allow the others to speak.

            "Jesus preaches with his own authority, as someone who possesses a doctrine derived from himself, and not like the scribes who repeated previous traditions and laws that had been handed down. They repeated words, words, words, only words. Instead Jesus\u2019 words have authority; Jesus has authority. And this touches the heart. Jesus\u2019 teaching has the same authority as God who speaks. Indeed, with a single command he easily frees the possessed man from the evil one, and heals him. Why? Because his word does what he says. Because he is the definitive prophet. Do we listen to Jesus\u2019 words, which have authority? Do not forget to always carry a small copy of the Gospel in your pocket or in your purse, to read throughout the day, to listen to that authoritative word of Jesus. (Angelus, 31 January 2021)",
            "\u201cThen each went to his own house\u201d. After debating everyone returned to their own convictions. There is a division within the people: the people who follow Jesus and who listen to Him - they are not aware of the time spent listening to Him, for the Word of Jesus enters the heart - and the group of the Doctors of the Law who reject Jesus a priori because, in their opinion, He was not observing the Law. The people were divided in two camps: The people who loved Jesus and followed Him, and the group of the intellectuals of the Law, the leaders of Israel, the leaders of the people. This is clear when the guards went to the chief priests who asked them: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you brought him?\u201d And the guards answered: \u201cThere has never been anybody who has spoken like him.\u201d But the Pharisees answered them: \u201cSo, you have been led astray as well? Have any of the authorities believed in him? Any of the Pharisees? This rabble knows nothing about the Law \u2013 they are damned (Jn 7:45-49). And this small group of the elite, the Doctors of the Law, despise Jesus. And they also despise the people, \u201cthat crowd\u201d which is ignorant and does not know anything. The holy, faithful People of God believe in Jesus, they follow him. And this small group of the elite, the doctors of the law, they separate themselves from the people and do not welcome Jesus. But why? They were illustrious, intelligent, they had studied. But they had a great defect: they had forgotten their own belonging to the people. (Santa Marta, 28 March 2020)"

If it remains closed within itself, nothing happens; but if instead it splits open, it germinates and then gives life to an ear of wheat; it sprouts, then becomes a plant, and the plant will bear fruit. In order to bear fruit, Jesus experienced love to the fullest, allowing himself to be split open by death as a seed lets itself be broken under the ground. Precisely there, at the lowest point of his abasement \u2014 which is also the loftiest point of love \u2014 hope bloomed. Should one of you ask: How is hope born? \u2014 From the Cross.

To explain the meaning of his death and resurrection, Jesus uses an image and says: \u201cunless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\u201d (Jn 12:24). He wants to explain that his extreme fate \u2014 that is the cross, death and resurrection \u2014 is an act of fruitfulness \u2014 his wounds have healed us \u2014 a fruitfulness that will bear fruit for many.\nAnd what does losing one\u2019s life mean? That is, what does it mean to be the grain of wheat?

In a way that makes us think. He says: \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified\u2026. Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\u201d (vv. 23-24). These words do not seem to respond to the request those Greeks made. In reality, they surpass it. In fact, Jesus reveals that for every man and woman who wants to find him, He is the hidden seed ready to die in order to bear much fruit. As if to say: if you wish to know me, if you wish to understand me, look at the grain of wheat that dies in soil, that is, look at the cross.\nThe sign of the Cross comes to mind, which over the centuries has become the symbol par excellence of Christians. Even today, those who wish to \u201csee Jesus\u201d, perhaps coming from countries and cultures where Christianity is not well-known, what do they see first? What is the most common sign they encounter? The Crucifix, the Cross. In churches, in the homes of Christians, even worn on their persons. The important thing is that the sign be consistent with the Gospel: the cross cannot but express love, service, unreserved self-giving: only in this way is it truly the \u201ctree of life\u201d, of overabundant life.

He is the man who doesn\u2019t speak but obeys, the man of tenderness, the man capable of carrying forward the promises so that they might become solid, certain; the man who guarantees the stability of the Kingdom of God, the paternity of God, our sonship as children of God. I like to think of Joseph as the guardian of weaknesses, of our weaknesses too: he is able to give birth to so many beautiful things from our weaknesses, even from our sins. Today I want to ask, grant to all of us the ability to dream, that when we dream great things, beautiful things, we might draw near to the dream of God, the things God dreams about us. [I ask] that he might give to young people \u2013 because he was young \u2013 the capacity to dream, to risk, to undertake the difficult tasks they have seen in dreams. And [I ask] him to give to all of us the faithfulness that tends to grow when we have a just attitude \u2013 Joseph was just \u2013 [the faithfulness that] grows in silence, with few words; that grows in tenderness that guards our own weaknesses and those of others.

(\u2026) You can entrust to him certain situations that are rather complicated, when you realise that your own strength is not enough, that there are no solutions at hand. Then you can turn to Saint Joseph in prayer. He is a man of few words - in the Gospel he never speaks, there are no words of Joseph - of few words but of many deeds. Try it. A man who listens to God\u2019s will and puts it into practice, without hesitation. I always pray to him, for this need, that other, and he always answers. (\u2026) And do you know how God revealed his will to him? In his sleep, while he slept. This is a fact recounted in the Gospels, and it also has a symbolic meaning: it is not just a question of dreams in the psychological sense, but of revelations of the divine plan, which he received in his sleep and then, on waking, immediately fulfilled. (\u2026) God's plans are not always clear; they often take time to manifest themselves, they require patience; above all, they require faith, a great deal of trust that God wants only and always the good, the greatest good for us and our loved ones.

Today, too, a dictatorship of uniform thought exists and this dictatorship is the same as the one established by the people: who \u201ctake up rocks to stone the freedom of nations, the freedom of the people, freedom of conscience, the people\u2019s relationship with God. And today Jesus is crucified once again\u201d. (Santa Marta, April 10, 2014)",
            "\u201cI invite you today to take five minutes, ten minutes, to sit down \u2013 without the radio, without the television \u2013 to sit down and reflect on your own story: the blessings and the troubles, everything. The graces and the sins, everything. And to see there the faithfulness of that God who remained faithful to His Covenant, remained faithful to the promise He made to Abraham, remained faithful to the salvation He promised in His Son, Jesus. I\u2019m certain that in the midst of all of the perhaps ugly things \u2013 because we all have them, so many ugly things in this life \u2013 if we do this today, we will discover the beauty of the love of God, the beauty of His mercy, the beauty of hope. And I am sure that we will all be full of joy.\u201d (Santa Marta, 6 April 2017)",
            " \u201cThis is precisely what these doctors of the law did not understand. They did not understand the joy of the promise; they didn\u2019t understand the joy of hope; they didn\u2019t understand the joy of the covenant. They did not understand. And they didn\u2019t know how to rejoice, for they had lost the sense of joy that only comes from faith. However, our father Abraham was able to rejoice because he had faith; he had been made righteous in faith. Meanwhile the doctors of the law had lost the faith: they were doctors of the law, but without faith!. Moreover: they had lost the law! Because the centre of law is love, love for God and for neighbour\u201d. (Santa Marta 26 March 2015)",
            "The joy of faith, the joy of the Gospel is the touchstone of a person\u2019s faith: without joy that person is not a true believer. We go home, but first we celebrate here with these words of Jesus: \u201cYour father Abraham rejoiced that he was glad to see my day; he saw it and was glad. Let us ask the Lord for the grace to rejoice in hope, the grace to be able to see the day of Jesus, when we will be with Him and the grace of joy. (Santa Marta, 26 March 2015)",
            "This is precisely what these doctors of the law did not understand.

            "The Lord remembers His covenant forever. (\u2026) His fidelity with Abraham is a memory of the promise He had made. God chose Abraham to take a certain road. Abraham was chosen, he was chosen. God chose him. Then in that election He promised him an inheritance and today, in the passage of the book of Genesis, there is another step. \u201cAs for me, this is my covenant with you\u201d (Gen 17:4). A covenant. A covenant that makes him see his fruitfulness in the future: \u201cYou shall become the father of a multitude of nations\u201d (Gen 17:4). The election, the promise and the covenant are the three dimensions of the life of faith, the three dimensions of Christian life. (\u2026)\nWe have been chosen, the Lord has made a promise to us, and now He asks for a covenant. A covenant of fidelity. Jesus says that Abraham exalted with joy thinking, seeing his day, the day of great fruitfulness, that son of his - Jesus was a son of Abraham (see Jn 8:56) - who came to remake creation, which is more difficult than making it, the liturgy says. He came to redeem our sins, to free us. (Santa Marta, 2 April 2020)"

What evil has he done?\"\nThey only shouted the louder, \"Crucify him.\"\nSo Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd,\nreleased Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged,\nhanded him over to be crucified.\nThe soldiers led him away inside the palace,\nthat is, the praetorium, and assembled the whole cohort.\nThey clothed him in purple and,\nweaving a crown of thorns, placed it on him.\nThey began to salute him with, AHail, King of the Jews!\"\nand kept striking his head with a reed and spitting upon him.\nThey knelt before him in homage.\nAnd when they had mocked him,\nthey stripped him of the purple cloak,\ndressed him in his own clothes,\nand led him out to crucify him.\nThey pressed into service a passer-by, Simon,\na Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country,\nthe father of Alexander and Rufus,\nto carry his cross.\nThey brought him to the place of Golgotha\n\u2014 which is translated Place of the Skull \u2014\nThey gave him wine drugged with myrrh,\nbut he did not take it.\nThen they crucified him and divided his garments\nby casting lots for them to see what each should take.\nIt was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him.\nThe inscription of the charge against him read,\n\"The King of the Jews.\"\nWith him they crucified two revolutionaries,\none on his right and one on his left.\nThose passing by reviled him,\nshaking their heads and saying,\n\"Aha! You who would destroy the temple\nand rebuild it in three days,\nsave yourself by coming down from the cross.\"\nLikewise the chief priests, with the scribes,\nmocked him among themselves and said,\n\"He saved others; he cannot save himself.\nLet the Christ, the King of Israel,\ncome down now from the cross\nthat we may see and believe.\"\nThose who were crucified with him also kept abusing him.\nAt noon darkness came over the whole land\nuntil three in the afternoon.\nAnd at three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice,\n\"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\"\nwhich is translated,\n\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\nSome of the bystanders who heard it said,\n\"Look, he is calling Elijah.\"\nOne of them ran, soaked a sponge with wine, put it on a reed\nand gave it to him to drink saying,\n\"Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.\"\nJesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.\nHere all kneel and pause for a short time.\nThe veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.\nWhen the centurion who stood facing him\nsaw how he breathed his last he said,\n\"Truly this man was the Son of God!\"\nThere were also women looking on from a distance.\nAmong them were Mary Magdalene,\nMary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and Salome.\nThese women had followed him when he was in Galilee\nand ministered to him.\nThere were also many other women\nwho had come up with him to Jerusalem.\nWhen it was already evening,\nsince it was the day of preparation,\nthe day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea,\na distinguished member of the council,\nwho was himself awaiting the kingdom of God,\ncame and courageously went to Pilate\nand asked for the body of Jesus.\nPilate was amazed that he was already dead.\nHe summoned the centurion\nand asked him if Jesus had already died.\nAnd when he learned of it from the centurion,\nhe gave the body to Joseph.\nHaving bought a linen cloth, he took him down,\nwrapped him in the linen cloth,\nand laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock.\nThen he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.\nMary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses\nwatched where he was laid.",

            "This is God\u2019s way, the way of humility. It is the way of Jesus; there is no other. And there can be no humility without humiliation.Following this path to the full, the Son of God took on the \u201cform of a slave\u201d (cf. Phil 2:7). In the end, humility also means service. It means making room for God by stripping oneself, \u201cemptying oneself\u201d, as Scripture says (v. 7). This \u2013 the pouring out of oneself - is the greatest humiliation of all. There is another way, however, opposed to the way of Christ. It is worldliness, the way of the world. The world proposes the way of vanity, pride, success\u2026 the other way. (\u2026) But Jesus immediately rejected it. With him, and only by his grace, with his help, we too can overcome this temptation to vanity, to worldliness, not only at significant moments, but in daily life as well.(\u2026) We think too of our brothers and sisters who are persecuted because they are Christians, the martyrs of our own time \u2013 and there are many. They refuse to deny Jesus and they endure insult and injury with dignity. They follow him on his way. In truth, we can speak of a \u201ccloud of witnesses\u201d \u2013 the martyrs of our own time.

            "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d  The forsakenness of Jesus.\nThis is the most searing of all sufferings, the suffering of the spirit.  At his most tragic hour, Jesus experiences abandonment by God. Prior to that moment, he had never called the Father by his generic name, \u201cGod\u201d.  To convey the impact of this, the Gospel also reports his words in Aramaic.  These are the only words of Jesus from the cross that have come down to us in the original language.  The real event is the extreme abasement, being forsaken by the Father, forsaken by God.  We find it hard even to grasp what great suffering he embraced out of love for us.  He sees the gates of heaven close, he finds himself at the bitter edge, the shipwreck of life, the collapse of certainty.  And he cries out: \u201cWhy?\u201d  A \u201cwhy\u201d that embraces every other \u201cwhy\u201d ever spoken.  \u201cWhy, God?\u201d. (\u2026) Why did it have to come to this?  He did it for us.  There is no other answer.  For us.  Brothers and sisters, today this is not merely a show.  Every one of us, hearing of Jesus\u2019 abandonment, can say: for me.  This abandonment is the price he paid for me.  He became one with each of us in order to be completely and definitively one with us to the very end.  He experienced abandonment in order not to leave us prey to despair, in order to stay at our side forever. (Homily, 2 April 2023)"

            "Such is the Christian life, a love story with God. The Lord freely takes the initiative and no one can claim to be the only one invited. No one has a better seat than anyone else, for all enjoy God\u2019s favour. The Christian life is always born and reborn of this tender, special and privileged love. We can ask ourselves if at least once a day we tell the Lord that we love him; if we remember, among everything else we say, to tell him daily, \u201cLord, I love you; you are my life\u201d. Because once love is lost, the Christian life becomes empty. It becomes a body without a soul, an impossible ethic, a collection of rules and laws to obey for no good reason. The God of life, however, awaits a response of life. The Lord of love awaits a response of love. Speaking to one of the Churches in the Book of Revelation, God makes an explicit reproach: \u201cYou have abandoned your first love\u201d (cf. Rev 2:4). This is the danger \u2013 a Christian life that becomes routine, content with \u201cnormality\u201d, without drive or enthusiasm, and with a short memory. Instead, let us fan into flame the memory of our first love. We are the beloved, the guests at the wedding, and our life is a gift, because every day is a wonderful opportunity to respond to God\u2019s invitation.

Binding oneself to him, in a true relationship of faith and love, does not mean being tied down, but being profoundly free, always on the journey. Each one of us can ask him- or herself: who is Jesus for me? Is he a name, an idea, simply an historical figure? Or is he truly that person who loves me and gave his life for me and walks with me?

This is the measure by which we will be judged. As you have forgiven, so you will be forgiven, in the same measure. Do not be afraid to forgive. Sometimes we have doubts; look to Christ [he looks to the Crucifix]. There, there is forgiveness for all. Be courageous, also in taking risks, in forgiving, in order to bring consolation.

As we contemplate Jesus in his Passion, we see reflected the suffering of humanity, and we discover the divine answer to the mystery of evil, suffering and death. Many times we feel horror at the evil and suffering that surrounds us and we ask ourselves: \u201cWhy does God allow it?\u201d. This week it would benefit all of us to look at the crucifix, to kiss the wounds of Jesus, to kiss them on the crucifix. He took upon himself all human suffering, he clothed himself in this suffering. (General Audience, 16 April 2014)",
            "We have an anchor: by his cross we have been saved. We have a rudder: by his cross we have been redeemed. We have a hope: by his cross we have been healed and embraced so that nothing and no one can separate us from his redeeming love. (\u2026) The Lord asks us from his cross to rediscover the life that awaits us, to look towards those who look to us, to strengthen, recognize and foster the grace that lives within us. Let us not quench the wavering flame (cf. Is 42:3) that never falters, and let us allow hope to be rekindled. (Extraordinary Moment of Prayer, 27 March 2020)",
            "There, he carries out his gift of love, and gave rise to our salvation springs. By dying on the Cross, innocent between two criminals, He certifies that the salvation of God can reach any man in any condition, even in the most negative and painful condition. God\u2019s salvation is for everyone, without exception. It is offered to everyone. Jesus is truly the face of the Father\u2019s mercy.",
            "\u201cOne of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water\u201d (Jn 19:34). Pierced, He gives; in death, He gives us life. (\u2026) John the Evangelist, at the very moment when he recounts the pierced side, from which blood and water flow, bears witness so that we may believe (cf. v. 35). Saint John writes, that is, that at that moment the testimony occurs. Because the pierced Heart of God is eloquent. It speaks without words, because it is mercy in its pure state, love that is wounded and gives life. It is God, with closeness, compassion and tenderness. How many words we say about God without showing love! But love speaks for itself, it does not speak of itself. (Homily, \u2018Agostino Gemelli\u2019, 5 November 2021)"

Like a new flame this Good News springs up in the night: the night of a world already faced with epochal challenges and now oppressed by a pandemic severely testing our whole human family.

Instead, it is the victory of love over the root of evil, a victory that does not \u201cby-pass\u201d suffering and death, but passes through them, opening a path in the abyss, transforming evil into good: this is the unique hallmark of the power of God.

The words heard by the women at the tomb are also addressed to us: \u201cWhy do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen\u201d. There is a word that transcends them, a word that only God can speak: it is the word of the resurrection. (Urbi et Orbi message, 1 April 2018)",
            "God asks us to view life as he views it, for in each of us he never ceases to see an irrepressible kernel of beauty. In sin, he sees sons and daughters to be restored; in desolation, hearts to be revived. Easter, is the feast of tombstones taken away, rocks rolled aside. God takes away even the hardest stones against which our hopes and expectations crash: death, sin, fear, worldliness. Human history does not end before a tombstone, because today it encounters the \u201cliving stone\u201d (cf. 1 Pet 2:4), the risen Jesus. We, as Church, are built on him, and, even when we grow disheartened and tempted to judge everything in the light of our failures, he comes to make all things new, to overturn our every disappointment. (Homily, Easter Vigil, 20 April 2019)",
            "\u201cChrist is risen; he is truly risen!\u201d In this traditional proclamation of the Churches of the East, the word \u201ctruly\u201d reminds us that our hope is not an illusion, but the truth! And that, in the wake of Easter, humanity\u2019s journey, now marked by hope, advances all the more readily. The first witnesses of the resurrection show this by their example. The Gospels speak of the haste with which, on the morning of Easter, the women \u201cran to tell the disciples\u201d (Mt 28:8). Mary Magdalene \u201cran and went to Simon Peter\u201d (Jn 20:2), while John and Peter himself then \u201cran together\u201d (cf. v. 4) to the place where Jesus had been buried. (\u2026) At Easter, then, the journey quickens and becomes a race, since humanity now sees the goal of its journey, the meaning of its destiny, Jesus Christ, and is called to make haste to meet him, who is the hope of the world.\nMay we too make haste to progress on a journey of reciprocal trust: trust among individuals, peoples and nations. May we allow ourselves to experience amazement at the joyful proclamation of Easter, at the light that illumines the darkness and the gloom in which, all too often, our world finds itself enveloped.\nLet us make haste to surmount our conflicts and divisions, and to open our hearts to those in greatest need. Let us hasten to pursue paths of peace and fraternity. (Urbi et Orbi, 9 April 2023)"

But Jesus himself appears to them on the way, saying: \u201cDo not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me\u201d (v. 10). With these words, the Risen One entrusts the women with a missionary mandate for the Apostles. Indeed, they offered an admirable example of faithfulness, of dedication, and of love for Christ throughout the time of his public life, as well as during his passion. Now they are rewarded by him with this gesture of attention and predilection. The women always at the beginning: Mary at the beginning, women at the beginning. (Regina Coeli, 13 April 2020)",
            "The Lord goes before us; he goes before us always. It is encouraging to know that he walks ahead of us in life and in death; he goes before us to Galilee, that is, to the place which for him and his disciples evoked the idea of daily life, family and work. Jesus wants us to bring hope there, to our everyday life. For the disciples, Galilee was also the place of remembrance, for it was the place where they were first called. Returning to Galilee means remembering that we have been loved and called by God. Each one of us has their own Galilee. (\u2026) But there is more. Galilee was the farthest region from where they were: from Jerusalem. And not only geographically. Galilee was also the farthest place from the sacredness of the Holy City. It was an area where people of different religions lived: it was the \u201cGalilee of the Gentiles\u201d (Mt 4:15). Jesus sends them there and asks them to start again from there. What does this tell us? That the message of hope should not be confined to our sacred places, but should be brought to everyone. (Homily, Easter vigil, 11 April 2020)",
            "Go and tell. Fear always closes us in on ourselves, while Jesus instead makes us go forth and sends us to others. This is the solution. We might say to ourselves, but I am not capable of doing this! But just think, those women were not perhaps the most suitable and prepared to proclaim the Resurrection, but that did not matter to the Lord. He cares that we go forth and proclaim. Go and tell. Go and tell. Because the Easter joy is not to be kept to oneself. The joy of Christ is strengthened by giving it, it multiplies sharing it. If we open ourselves and bear the Gospel, our hearts will open and overcome fear. This is the secret: to proclaim in order to overcome fear. (Regina Caeli, 18 April 2022)"

And there, it encounters people with their hopes and disappointments, burdensome at times. The Church listens to everyone\u2019s stories as they emerge from the treasure chest of personal conscience, in order to then offer the Word of Life, the witness of love, a love that is faithful until the end.

And therefore, Jesus begins his \u201ctherapy of hope\u201d. What takes place on this road is a therapy of hope. Who administers it? Jesus. Firstly, He asks and listens. Our God is not an intrusive God. Even though he knows the reason for the disappointment of those two men, he gives them time to be able to deeply fathom the bitterness which has overcome them. Out of this comes a confession that is a refrain in human existence. \u201cWe had hoped, but.... We had hoped, but...\u201d (v. 21). How much sadness, how many defeats, how many failures there are in the lives of every person! Deep down, we are all a little like those two disciples. How many times we have hoped in our lives. How many times we have felt like we were one step away from happiness only to find ourselves knocked to the ground, disappointed.

The body is created by God, and mankind is not complete if there is no union of body and soul. Jesus, who has triumphed over death and risen in body and soul, helps us to understand that we must have a positive idea of our body. It can become an occasion or instrument of sin, but sin is not provoked by the body, but rather by our moral weakness. The body is a wondrous gift from God, intended, in union with the soul, to express in fullness the image and likeness of Him. Therefore, we are called to have great respect and care for our body and that of others. Any offense or wound or violence to the body of our neighbour is an affront to God the Creator!

He found himself before the Messiah filled with kindness, mercy, tenderness. Thomas understood the profound significance of his Resurrection and, intimately transformed, he declared his full and total faith in Him exclaiming: \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d(v. 28) Beautiful, Thomas\u2019 expression is beautiful!

(Regina Caeli, Saint Peter's Square Second Sunday of Easter (or Divine Mercy Sunday), 12 April 2015)\n ",
            "Jesus invites us to behold these wounds, to touch them as Thomas did, to heal our lack of belief. Above all, he invites us to enter into the mystery of these wounds, which is the mystery of his merciful love. Faced with the tragic events of human history we can feel crushed at times, asking ourselves, \u201cWhy?\u201d. Humanity\u2019s evil can appear in the world like an abyss, a great void: empty of love, empty of goodness, empty of life. And so we ask: how can we fill this abyss? For us it is impossible; only God can fill this emptiness that evil brings to our hearts and to human history. It is Jesus, God made man, who died on the Cross and who fills the abyss of sin with the depth of his mercy. (Homily, Mass for the faithful of Armenian Rite, 12 April 2015)",
            "He was stubborn. But the Lord precisely wanted a stubborn person to make us understand something greater. Thomas saw the Lord, he was invited to put his finger into the wound made by the nail, to put his hand into Jesus\u2019s side. And he did not say: \u201cIt is true: the Lord has risen!\u201d No! He went beyond. He said: \u201cGod!\u201d The first of the disciples that make a confession in Christ\u2019s divinity after the Resurrection. And he adored. (Homily, Santa Marta, 3 July 2013)",
            "Thomas was one who was not satisfied and seeks, intending to confirm himself, to have his own personal experience. After initial resistance and apprehension, in the end even he was able to believe, even though through effort, he came to believe. Jesus waited for him patiently and offered himself to the difficulties and uncertainty of the last to arrive. The Lord proclaimed \u201cblessed\u201d, those who believe without seeing (cf. v. 29) the first of which is Mary his Mother. He also met the needs of the doubting disciple: \u201cPut your finger here, and see my hands...\u201d (Regina Coeli, 12 April 2015)",
            "The Lord is not looking for perfect Christians; the Lord is not looking for Christians who never doubt and always flaunt a steadfast faith. When a Christian is like that, something isn\u2019t right. No, the adventure of faith, as for Thomas, consists of lights and shadows. Otherwise, what kind of faith would that be? It knows times of comfort, zeal and enthusiasm, but also of weariness, confusion, doubt and darkness. The Gospel shows us Thomas\u2019 \u201ccrisis\u201d to tell us that we should not fear the crises of life and faith. Crises are not sins, they are part of the journey, we should not fear them. Many times, they make us humble because they strip us of the idea that we are fine, that we are better than others. Crises help us to recognize that we are needy: they rekindle the need for God and thus enable us to return to the Lord, to touch his wounds, to experience his love anew as if it were the first time. Dear brothers and sisters, is better to have an imperfect but humble faith that always returns to Jesus, than a strong but presumptuous faith that makes us proud and arrogant. Woe to those, woe to them! (Regina Caeli, II Sunday of Easter, Divine Mercy, 24 April 2022)",

And how many of us are searching deep in our heart to meet Jesus, just as He is: kind, merciful, tender! For we know, deep down, that He is like this. Having rediscovered personal contact with Christ who is amiable and mercifully patient, Thomas understood the profound significance of his Resurrection and, intimately transformed, he declared his full and total faith in Him exclaiming: \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d (v. 28).

The Lord is with you.\"\nBut she was greatly troubled at what was said\nand pondered what sort of greeting this might be.\nThen the angel said to her,\n\"Do not be afraid, Mary,\nfor you have found favor with God.\nBehold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,\nand you shall name him Jesus.\nHe will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,\nand the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,\nand he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,\nand of his Kingdom there will be no end.\"\nBut Mary said to the angel,\n\"How can this be,\nsince I have no relations with a man?\"\nAnd the angel said to her in reply,\n\"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,\nand the power of the Most High will overshadow you.\nTherefore the child to be born\nwill be called holy, the Son of God.\nAnd behold, Elizabeth, your relative,\nhas also conceived a son in her old age,\nand this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;\nfor nothing will be impossible for God.\"\nMary said, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.\nMay it be done to me according to your word.\"\nThen the angel departed from her.",

            "\"Nothing is impossible to God\" (Lk 1:37): so ends the Angel's response to Mary. When we believe that everything depends exclusively on us, we remain prisoners of our abilities, our strengths, our short-sighted horizons. But when we are ready to let ourselves be helped, allow ourselves to be counseled, when we open ourselves to grace, it seems that the impossible begins to become reality. (In Milan at Monza Park, March 25, 2017)",

She does not say: \u201cWell, this time I will do God\u2019s will; I will make myself available, then I will see...\u201d. No. Hers is a full, total \u2018yes\u2019, for her entire life, without conditions. And just as the original \u2018no\u2019 closed the passage between man and God, so Mary\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 opened the path to God among us.

            "Dear brothers and sisters, for us too there are moments of weariness and disillusion. Thus let us remember these words of the Lord, which give us so much consolation and allow us to understand whether we are placing our energy at the service of the good. Indeed, at times our weariness is caused by placing trust in things that are not essential, because we have distanced ourselves from what really matters in life. The Lord teaches us not to be afraid to follow Him, because the hope that we place in Him will never disappoint. Thus, we are called to learn from Him what it means to live on mercy so as to be instruments of mercy. (General Audience, 14 September 2016)",

Thank you, because with your purity, you encourage us not to be ashamed of good, but of evil; you help us to keep at a distance the evil one, who deceives us and draws us to himself, into coils of death; you grant us the gentle reminder that we are children of God, Father of immense goodness, eternal source of life, beauty and love.

            "Today\u2019s celebration and the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe make me think of three adjectives for her: Lady/woman, mother and mestizo. Mary is a woman. She is a woman, she is a Lady, the Nican mapohu, as she is called. She is a woman with the nobility of women. She presents herself as a woman, and she presents herself with a still another message, that is, she is a woman, a lady, and a disciple. St Ignatius loved to call her Our Lady. And it is so simple, she does not claim anything else: she is a woman, a disciple. (Homily, 12 December 2019).",
            "Mary\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d contains the \u201cyes\u201d of all of Salvation History. It initiates the ultimate \u201cyes\u201d of man and of God. May the Lord grant us the grace to take this road of men and women who have been able to say \u201cyes\u201d. (Santa Marta, 4 April 2016)",

            "Today\u2019s liturgical feast celebrates one of the wonders of the history of salvation: the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. Even she was saved by Christ, but in an extraordinary way, because God wanted that the mother of his Son not be touched by the misery of sin from the moment of conception. And thus, for the entire course of her earthly life, Mary was free from any stain of sin, she was \u201cfull of grace\u201d. (Angelus 8 December 2020)",
            "Here I am is the key phrase for life. It marks the passage from a horizontal life, centred on oneself and one\u2019s own needs, to a vertical life, ascending toward God. Here I am is being available to the Lord; it is the cure for selfishness, the antidote to a dissatisfied life, which is always lacking something.  It is choosing to bet on the Lord, docile to his surprises. This does not mean that life was easy for her, no. Being with God does not magically resolve problems. But faced with problems, Mary places her trust in God. She trusts in God. (Angelus, 8 December 2018)",
            "God made himself flesh. And when we say this, in the Creed, on Christmas Day, on the day of the Annunciation, we kneel to worship this mystery of the incarnation. God made himself flesh and blood; he lowered himself to the point of becoming a man like us. He humbled himself to the extent of burdening himself with our sufferings and sin, and therefore he asks us to seek him not outside of life and history, but in relationship with Christ and with our brothers and sisters. Seeking him in life, in history, in our daily life. And this, brothers and sisters, is the road to the encounter with God: the relationship with Christ and our brothers and sisters.

            "Let us remember that this perfection of Mary, the [one who is] full of grace, is declared by the angel within the walls of her house \u2014 not in Nazareth\u2019s main square, but there, in hiding, in the greatest humility. In that little house of Nazareth beats the greatest heart that any creature has ever had. Dear brothers and sisters, this is extraordinary news for us! Because it tells us that, in order to work marvellous deeds, the Lord has no need of grand means and our lofty abilities, but rather of our humility, of our eyes open to him, and also open to others. With this annunciation, within the poor walls of a small house, God changed history. (Angelus, 8 December 2021)",
            "When there is no prophecy among the people, clericalism fills the void. It is precisely this clericalism that asks Jesus: \u2018by what authority do you do these things, by what legal authorization?\u2019. The memory of the promise and hope to go forward are reduced only to the present: neither the past, nor a future and hope. The present is legal, and if it is legal go ahead. He prayed to the Lord that prophets not be lacking among his people. All of us who are baptized are prophets. Lord, may we not forget your promise; may we never grow weary of going forward; may we never close ourselves in through a legality that closes doors. (Santa Marta, 16 Dec 2013)",
            "He tells Our Lady to \u201cRejoice\u201d. In an isolated hamlet of Galilee, in the heart of a young woman unknown to the world, God kindles the spark of happiness for the entire world. And today, the same announcement is addressed to the Church, called to receive the Gospel so that it may become flesh, concrete life. He says to the Church, to all of us: \u201cRejoice, little Christian community, poor and humble but beautiful in my eyes because you ardently desire my Kingdom, you hunger and thirst for justice, you patiently weave the fabric of peace, you do not pursue the powerful of the moment but remain faithfully beside the poor. And thus you fear nothing but your heart is in joy\u201d. (Angelus, 16 December 2018)",
            "Certainly, the divine message would have filled Mary\u2019s heart with light and strength; nevertheless, she found herself faced with a crucial decision: to say \u201cyes\u201d to God, risking everything, even her life, or to decline the invitation and continue along her ordinary journey.\nWhat does she do? She responds thus: \u201cLet it be to me according to your word\u201d (Lk 1:38). \u201cLet it be \u201d (\u201cFiat \u201d). But in the language in which the Gospel is written, it is not simply \u201clet it be\u201d. The verbal expression indicates a strong desire; it indicates the will that something happen. In other words, Mary does not say: \u201cIf it has to happen, let it happen..., if it cannot be otherwise\u2026\u201d. It is not resignation. (\u2026) She is a woman in love prepared to serve her Lord completely and immediately. (Angelus, 20 December 2020)",
            "In today\u2019s Gospel the Angel\u2019s greeting to Mary resounds: \u201cHail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!\u201d (Lk 1:28). God has always thought of her and wanted her in his inscrutable plan, to be a creature full of grace, that is, full of his love. Yet, in order to be filled it is necessary to make room, to empty oneself, to step aside. Just as Mary did, she who knew how to listen to the Word of God and trust totally in his will, accepting it unreservedly in her own life. So much so that the Word became flesh in her. This was possible thanks to her \u201cyes\u201d. To the Angel who asks her to be ready to become the mother of Jesus, Mary replies: \u201cBehold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word\u201d (v. 38). Mary does not lose herself in reasoning, she does not place obstacles in the Lord\u2019s way, but she promptly entrusts herself and makes room for the action of the Holy Spirit. She immediately makes her whole being and her personal history available to God, so that the Word and the will of God may shape and bring them to fulfilment. Perfectly corresponding to God\u2019s plan for her, Mary then becomes the \u201call beautiful\u201d, the \u201call holy\u201d, but without the slightest shadow of complacency. She is humble. She is a masterpiece, whilst remaining humble, small, poor. In her is reflected the beauty of God which is all love, grace, gift of self. (Angelus, 8 December 2019)",
            "In this Gospel passage, we notice a contrast between the promises of the angel and Mary\u2019s response. This contrast is manifested in the dimension and content of the expressions of the two protagonists. The angel says to Mary: \u201cDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever\u201d (vv. 30-33). It is a long revelation which opens unprecedented possibilities. (\u2026) On the other hand, Mary\u2019s reply is a short sentence that does not speak of glory. It does not speak of privilege but only of willingness and service: \u201cBehold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word\u201d. (\u2026)Thus Our Lady shows that she is in perfect accord with God\u2019s plan. (\u2026) Mary\u2019s behaviour corresponds perfectly to that of the Son of God when he comes into the world. He wants to become the Servant of the Lord, to put himself at the service of humanity to fulfil the Father\u2019s plan. Mary\u2019s attitude fully mirrors this statement by the Son of God who also becomes the son of Mary. (Angelus, 24 December 2017)\n ",
            "The angel Gabriel greets the Virgin like this: \u201cHail, full of grace, the Lord is with you\u201d (v. 28). He does not call her by her name, Mary, but with a new name, that she did not know: full of grace. Full of grace, and therefore free from sin, is the name God gives her and that we celebrate today. (\u2026) To safeguard our beauty demands a cost, it demands a struggle. Indeed, the Gospel shows us the courage of Mary who said \u201cYes\u201d to God, who chose the risk of God; and the passage from Genesis, on original sin, speaks to us of a battle against the tempter and his temptations (cf. Gen 3:15). But we know this from experience too, all of us: it takes effort to choose good, it costs us; it takes effort to safeguard the good that is in us. Think of how many times we have squandered it by giving in to the lure of evil, being crafty for our own interests or doing something that would defile our hearts; or even wasting time in useless or harmful things, putting off prayer, for example, and saying \u201cToday I can\u2019t\u201d, or saying \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d to those who have needed us, when instead we could have.\nBut today, faced with all this, we have good news: Mary, the only human being in history without sin, is with us in the battle, she is our sister and, above all, our Mother. (Angelus, 8 December 2022)",
            "He goes looking for that one, because every one is very important to him and that one is in the most need, is the most abandoned, most discarded; and he goes to look for it. (\u2026) God does not share our current throw-away culture; it doesn\u2019t count to God. God throws no one away; God loves everyone, looks for everyone: one by one! He doesn\u2019t know what \u201cthrowing people away\u201d means, because he is entirely love, entirely mercy. (\u2026)\nThe Lord, then, should be sought precisely where he wants to find us, not where we presume to find him! There is no other way to reassemble the flock except by following the path outlined by the mercy of the shepherd. (\u2026) We must not be closed in or we will smell like stale things.\nTo the last moment, God is searching for us. Think of the good thief; in Jesus\u2019 vision there are no sheep that are definitively lost, but only sheep that must be found again. (General Audience, 4 May 2016)",
            "Within the domestic walls, a person reveals him or herself better than elsewhere. And it is precisely within that domestic intimacy that the Gospel gives us a detail that reveals the beauty of Mary\u2019s heart. The angel calls her \u201cfull of grace\u201d. (\u2026) Let us remember that this perfection of Mary, the [one who is] full of grace, is declared by the angel within the walls of her house \u2014 not in Nazareth\u2019s main square, but there, in hiding, in the greatest humility. In that little house of Nazareth beats the greatest heart that any creature has ever had. Dear brothers and sisters, this is extraordinary news for us! Because it tells us that, in order to work marvellous deeds, the Lord has no need of grand means and our lofty abilities, but rather of our humility, of our eyes open to him, and also open to others. With this annunciation, within the poor walls of a small house, God changed history. Today too, he wants to do great things with us in our daily lives: that is, in our families, at work, in everyday environments. God\u2019s grace loves to operate there more than in great historical events. (\u2026) Let us ask Our Lady for a grace: that she may free us from the misleading idea that the Gospel is one thing and life is another; that she kindle our enthusiasm for the ideal of holiness which is not a matter of holy cards and images, but is about living what happens each day, humbly and joyfully, like Our Lady, free from ourselves, with our eyes fixed on God and the neighbour we meet. (Angelus, 8 December 2021)",
            "To be born from above is to be born with the strength of the Holy Spirit. We cannot keep the Holy Spirit for ourselves; we can only allow Him to transform us. And our docility opens the door to the Holy Spirit; it is He who changes us, who works this transformation in us, this rebirth from on high. This is the promise that Jesus makes: to send the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is capable of wondrous things that we cannot even imagine. An example is this first Christian community, which is not a fantasy, this is what they say here: it is a model, at which we can arrive when there is docility and one allows the Holy Spirit to enter and to transform. An ideal community, let\u2019s say. It is true that immediately after this, problems begin, but the Lord makes us see up to what point we can arrive if we are open to the Holy Spirit, if we are docile. There is harmony in this community. The Holy Spirit is the master of harmony; He is capable of making it, and He has made it happen here. It is what needs to happen in our hearts, many things in us must change to create harmony, because He Himself is harmony. Also the harmony between the Father and the Son: it is He, the love of harmony. And He, with harmony, creates these things such as this community, which was so harmonious. But then, history tells us - the same Book of the Acts of the Apostles - of many problems in the community. This is a model: the Lord has permitted this model of an almost \u201cheavenly\u201d community, to make us see where we should arrive. (Santa Marta, 21 April 2020)"

Does each of us have the wish to be born ever anew in order to meet the Lord? Do you have this wish? Indeed, one can easily lose it because, due to so many activities, so many projects to implement, in the end we are short of time and we lose sight of what is fundamental: the inner life of the heart, our spiritual life, our life which is the encounter with the Lord in prayer.

And our docility opens the door to the Holy Spirit; it is He who changes us, who works this transformation in us, this rebirth from on high. This is the promise that Jesus makes: to send the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is capable of wondrous things that we cannot even imagine. An example is this first Christian community, which is not a fantasy, this is what they say here: it is a model, at which we can arrive when there is docility and one allows the Holy Spirit to enter and to transform. An ideal community, let\u2019s say. It is true that immediately after this, problems begin, but the Lord makes us see up to what point we can arrive if we are open to the Holy Spirit, if we are docile. There is harmony in this community. The Holy Spirit is the master of harmony; He is capable of making it, and He has made it happen here. It is what needs to happen in our hearts, many things in us must change to create harmony, because He Himself is harmony. Also the harmony between the Father and the Son: it is He, the love of harmony. And He, with harmony, creates these things such as this community, which was so harmonious. But then, history tells us - the same Book of the Acts of the Apostles - of many problems in the community. This is a model: the Lord has permitted this model of an almost \u201cheavenly\u201d community, to make us see where we should arrive. (Santa Marta, 21 April 2020)"

It is the same gesture that Jesus was to make at the Last Supper, when he established the perpetual memorial of his Redeeming Sacrifice. In the Eucharist Jesus does not give just any bread, but the bread of eternal life, he gives Himself, offering Himself to the Father out of love for us. But we must go to the Eucharist with those sentiments of Jesus, which are compassion and the will to share. One who goes to the Eucharist without having compassion for the needy and without sharing, is not at ease with Jesus. (Angelus, August 3, 2014)",

He orders the disciples to make the people sit down, then he takes those loaves and those fish, gives thanks to the Father and distributes them. These acts prefigure the Last Supper, which gives the bread of Jesus its truest significance. The bread of God is Jesus Himself. By receiving Him in Communion, we receive his life within us and we become children of the Heavenly Father and brothers and sisters among ourselves. By receiving communion we meet Jesus truly living and risen! Taking part in the Eucharist means entering into the logic of Jesus, the logic of giving freely, of sharing. And as poor as we are, we all have something to give. \u201cTo receive Communion\u201d means to draw from Christ the grace which enables us to share with others all we are and all we have.

He is immersed in the life of His people, He understands their fatigue and their limitations, but He does not allow anyone to be lost, or to lose out: He nourishes them with His word and provides food in plenty for sustenance.

            "This is a great lesson for us. It tells us that the Lord can do a lot with the little that we put at His disposal.

He can do a lot with one of our prayers, with a gesture of charity for others, even with one of our sufferings handed over to His mercy. Our small things to Jesus, and He works miracles. This is how God loves to act: He does great things, starting from those small things, those freely-given ones. All the great protagonists of the Bible - from Abraham, to Mary, to the boy today - show this logic of smallness and giving. (Angelus, 25 July 2021)",
            "This sentence in this passage from the Gospel makes us think: \u201cHe said this to put him to the test, He Himself knew exactly what He was going to do\u201d (see Jn 6:6). And that is what Jesus had in mind when He asked Philip, \u201cWhere can we buy some bread for these people to eat?\u201d (v. 5). He said it to put him to the test. He knew. Here we observe Jesus\u2019s behaviour with the disciples. He continually put them to the test in order to teach them. And when they deviated from the function they were to perform, He would stop them and teach them. (\u2026)  And Jesus answers, to put them to the test, \u201cYou give them something to eat\u201d (see v. 13). And this is what Jesus says today to all pastors: \u201cYou give them something to eat\u201d. \u201cAre they anguished? Give them consolation. Are they lost? Give them a way out. Have they made mistakes? Help to solve the problems. (Santa Marta, 24 April 2020)",
            "We try to accumulate and increase what we have, but Jesus asks us to give, to diminish. We like to add, we like addition; Jesus likes subtraction, taking something away to give it to others. We want to multiply for ourselves; Jesus appreciates it when we share with others, when we share. It is interesting that in the accounts of the multiplication of the loaves in the Gospels, the verb \u201cmultiply\u201d never appears: no. On the contrary, the verbs used have the opposite meaning: \u201cto break\u201d, \u201cto give\u201d, \u201cto distribute\u201d. But the verb \u201cto multiply\u201d is not used. The true miracle, says Jesus, is not the multiplication that produces vanity and power, but the sharing that increases love and allows God to perform wonders. Let us try to share more: let us try the way Jesus teaches us. (Angelus, 25 July 2021)"

At a certain point, they see someone walking on the water, coming toward them. Upset, they think it is a ghost and cry out in fear. Jesus reassures them: \u201cTake heart, it is I; have no fear\u201d. (\u2026) In dark moments, in sad moments He is well aware that our faith is weak \u2013all of us are people of little faith, all of us, myself included, everyone \u2013 and that our faith is weak our journey can be troubled, hindered by adverse forces. But He is the Risen One! Let\u2019s not forget this: He is the Lord who passed through death in order to lead us to safety. Even before we begin to seek Him, He is present beside us lifting us back up after our falls, He helps us grow in faith. Maybe in the dark, we cry out: \u201cLord, Lord!\u201d thinking He is far away. And He says, \u201cI am here.\u201d Ah, He was with me! That is the Lord. The boat at the mercy of the storm is the image of the Church, which in every age encounters headwinds, very harsh trials at times: we recall certain long and ferocious persecutions of the last century and even today in certain places. In situations like that, she may be tempted to think that God has abandoned her. But in reality it is precisely in those moments that the witness of faith, the witness of love, the witness of hope shines the most. It is the presence of the Risen Christ in His Church that gives the grace of witness unto martyrdom, from which buds new Christians and fruit of reconciliation and peace for the entire world.

            "Martyrdom is the translation of a Greek word that also means witness. And so we can say that for a Christian the path follows in the footsteps of this witness, Christ\u2019s footsteps, to bear witness to Him and, many times, this witness ends up in laying down one\u2019s life. You cannot understand a Christian without witness. (\u2026) The central issue, is that Christianity is not a religion only of ideas, of pure theology, of aesthetics, of commandments. We are a people who follow Jesus Christ and bear witness, who want to bear witness to Jesus Christ. And this witness sometimes leads to the giving of one\u2019s life. For bearing witness is always fruitful: it is fruitful when it happens in daily life, but also when it is lived out in time of difficulty or when it leads to death. Indeed, the Church is fruitful and a mother when she bears witness to Jesus Christ. However, when the Church withdraws into herself, when she thinks of herself as a university of religion with many beautiful ideas, with many beautiful places of worship, with many beautiful museums, with many beautiful things, but she does not give testimony, she becomes barren. The same reasoning is valid for individual Christians: if one does not bear witness, one remains sterile, without bearing the life one has received from Jesus Christ. (Santa Marta, 6 May 2014)",

That is the final and inevitable moment, one that all of us will have to face. Every life decision, viewed from that perspective, will be well directed, since it is closer to the resurrection, which is the meaning and purpose of life. As the departure is calculated by the goal, as the planting is judged by the harvest, so life is best judged by starting from its end and purpose. Saint Ignatius writes: \u201cLet me consider myself as standing in the presence of my judge on the last day, and reflect what decision on the present matter I would then wish to have made; I will choose now the rule of life that I would then wish to have observed\u201d (Spiritual Exercises, 187). It can be a helpful exercise to view reality through the eyes of the Lord and not only through our own; to look to the future, the resurrection, and not only to this passing day; to make choices that have the flavour of eternity, the taste of love.\nDo I go forth from myself each day in order to come to the Lord? Do I feel and practise compassion for those in need? Do I make important decisions in the sight of God? Let us allow ourselves to be challenged at least by one of these three thoughts. We will be more attuned to the desire that Jesus expresses in today\u2019s Gospel: that he lose nothing of what the Father has given him (cf. Jn 6:39). Amid so many worldly voices that make us forget the meaning of life, let us grow attuned to the will of Jesus, risen and alive. Thus we will make of our lives this day a dawn of resurrection.

In other words, without him, rather than living, we get by: because he alone nourishes the soul; he alone forgives us from that evil that we cannot overcome on our own; he alone makes us feel loved even if everyone else disappoints us; he alone gives us the strength to love and, he alone gives us the strength to forgive in difficulties; he alone gives that peace to the heart that it is searching for; he alone gives eternal life when life here on earth ends. He is the essential bread of life. (\u2026)\nThese words of the Lord reawaken in us our amazement for the gift of the Eucharist.

And we are sinners, but in a holy Church. And we too are sanctified with this belonging to the Church: we are children of Church, and Mother Church sanctifies us, with her love, with the Sacraments of her Spouse. Saint Paul in his letters speaks to the saints, to us: sinners, but children of the holy Church, sanctified by the Body and the Blood of Jesus. In this holy Church the Lord chooses certain people so that holiness can be better seen, to show that it is He who sanctifies, that no one sanctifies himself, that there\u2019s no course to become a saint, that it\u2019s not being a religious fraud or something of that sort\u2026 No! It\u2019s not that! Holiness is a gift of Jesus to His Church and to show this He chooses people in whom His work of sanctifying is clearly seen.

Jesus\u2019 voice is unique! If we learn to distinguish it, he guides us on the path of life, a path that goes beyond even the abyss of death. (Angelus, 21 April 2013)",
            "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand\u201d. Did these sheep learn by following Jesus, and then believe? No. \u2018My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all\u2019. It is thus the Father who gives the sheep to the shepherd; it is the Father who draws hearts to Jesus.\nAnd the humble prayer that we can say as daughters and sons is: \u2018Father, draw me to Jesus; Father, lead me to know Jesus\u2019, and the Father will send the Spirit to open our hearts and lead us to Jesus. (Santa Marta, 19 April 2016)",
            "Let us not forget that Jesus is the only Shepherd who speaks to us, knows us, gives us eternal life and safeguards us. We are the only flock and we only have to strive to hear his voice, while he lovingly examines the sincerity of our hearts. And from this constant intimacy with our Shepherd, from this colloquy with him, springs the joy of following him, allowing ourselves to be led to the fullness of eternal life. (Regina Coeli, 12 May 2019)",
            "These words communicate to us a sense of absolute security and immense tenderness. Our life is fully secure in the hands of Jesus and the Father, which are a single thing: a unique love, a unique mercy, revealed once and for all in the sacrifice of the Cross. Nothing and no one can take us from the hands of Jesus, because nothing and no one can overcome his love. Jesus\u2019 love is invincible. (Regina Caeli, 17 April 2016)",
            "These words help us to understand that no one can call himself a follower of Jesus, if he does not listen to His voice. And this \u201clistening\u201d should not be understood in a superficial way, but in an engaging way, to the point of making possible a true mutual understanding, from which one can come to a generous following, expressed in the words, \u2018and they follow me\u2019 (Jn 10:27). It is a matter of listening not only with ears, but listening with the heart! Jesus\u2019 love is invincible. The evil one, the great enemy of God and of His creatures, attempts in many ways to take eternal life from us. But the evil one can do nothing if we ourselves do not open the doors of our hearts to him, by following his deceitful enticements. The Virgin Mary heard and obediently followed the voice of the Good Shepherd. May she help us to welcome with joy Jesus\u2019 invitation to become His disciples, and to always live in the certainty of being in the paternal hands of the Father. (Regina Caeli, 17 April 2016)",
            "The image of the shepherd and the sheep indicates the close relationship that Jesus wants to establish with each one of us. He is our guide, our teacher, our friend, our model, but above all he is our Saviour. In fact, the following expressions from the Gospel passage affirm, \u201cI give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand\u201d (v. 28). Who can say that? Only Jesus, because the \u201chand\u201d of Jesus is one thing with the \u201chand\u201d of the Father, and the Father is \u201cgreater than all\u201d (cf. v. 29).\nThese words communicate to us a sense of absolute security and immense tenderness. Our life is fully secure in the hands of Jesus and the Father, which are a single thing: a unique love, a unique mercy, revealed once and for all in the sacrifice of the Cross. To save the lost sheep which we all are, the Shepherd became lamb, and let himself be immolated so as to take upon himself and to take away the sin of the world. In this way he has given us life, life in abundance (cf. Jn 10:10)! This mystery is renewed, in an always surprising humility, on the Eucharistic table. It is there that the sheep gather to nourish themselves; it is there that they become one, among themselves and with the Good Shepherd.\nBecause of this we are no longer afraid: our life is now saved from perdition. Nothing and no one can take us from the hands of Jesus, because nothing and no one can overcome his love. (Regina Caeli, 17 April 2016)"

It is not something that can be purchased or that we obtain by force, no: it is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. What makes the heart joyful is the Holy. Spirit. Joy is not going through the day laughing. No, it is not that. Joy is not enjoying oneself. No, that is not it. It is something else.

In this sense, Jesus assures them that their mission will be supported by the Holy Spirit. (\u2026) This is how this mission was able to be accomplished, and the Apostles began this work which was then continued by their successors. The mission that Jesus entrusted to the Apostles has continued through the centuries, and continues still today: it requires the cooperation of all of us.

Baptism is precisely what qualifies us and also spurs us to be missionaries, to proclaim the Gospel. (Regina Caeli, 13 May 2018)",
            "The Ascension completes Jesus\u2019 mission among us. Indeed, if it is for us that Jesus descended from heaven, it is also for us that he ascends there. After having descended into our humanity and redeemed it \u2014 God, the Son of God, descends and becomes man, takes our humanity and redeems it \u2014 he now ascends into heaven, taking our flesh with him. He is the first man who enters heaven, because Jesus is man, true man; he is God, true God; our flesh is in heaven and this gives us joy. Now a human body sits at the right hand of the Father for the first time, the body of Jesus, and in this mystery we each contemplate our own future destination. This is not at all an abandonment; Jesus remains forever with the disciples \u2014 with us. He remains in prayer, because as man, he prays to the Father, and as God, man and God, he shows Him his wounds, the wounds by which he has redeemed us. Jesus\u2019 prayer is there, with our flesh: he is one of us, God-man, and he prays for us.\nAnd this should give us confidence, or rather joy, great joy! And the second reason for joy is Jesus\u2019 promise. He told us: \u201cI will send you the Holy Spirit\u201d. And there, with the Holy Spirit, that commandment is made that he gives in his farewell: \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel\u201d. And it will be the power of the Holy Spirit that will lead us there into the world, to bring the Gospel. It is the Holy Spirit of that day, whom Jesus promised, and then nine days later he will come on the Feast of Pentecost. (Regina Caeli, 16 May 2021)",
            "Jesus, Risen and Ascended into heaven, sends his disciples to spread the Gospel throughout the world. Therefore, the Ascension exhorts us to lift our gaze toward heaven, in order to return it immediately to the earth, to implement the tasks that the Risen Lord entrusts to us. (\u2026)\nThe Lord\u2019s Ascension into heaven, while inaugurating a new form of Jesus\u2019 presence among us, calls us to keep eyes and hearts open to encounter him, to serve him and bear witness to him to others. It is a matter of being men and women of the Ascension, that is, those who seek Christ along the paths of our time, bringing his word of salvation to the ends of the earth. On this journey we encounter Christ himself in our brothers and sisters, especially in the poorest, in those who suffer in their very flesh the harsh and humiliating experience of old and new forms of poverty. As at the beginning the Risen Christ sent his Apostles with the power of the Holy Spirit, so too does he send all of us today, with the same power, so as to establish concrete and visible signs of hope. Because Jesus gives us hope. He went to heaven and opened the gates of heaven and the hope that we will reach it. (Regina Caeli, 13 May 2018)"

He washes our feet, and says to us: serve each other in this manner, but be careful: a servant is never greater than the one who sends him, than the master.

A community of Christians should live in the charity of Christ, and instead, it is precisely there that the evil one \u201csets his foot in\u201d and sometimes we allow ourselves to be deceived. How many people have distanced themselves, for example, from some parish or community because of the environment of gossip, jealousy, and envy they found there.

            "How can we understand if we truly have faith, that is, if our faith, while miniscule, is genuine, pure, sincere? Jesus explains this by indicating what the measure of faith is: service.

Unworthy servants, that is, without expecting to be thanked, without pretexts. \u201cWe are unworthy servants\u201d is an expression of humility and willingness, which does much good for the Church and recalls the right attitude for working within her: humble service, of which Jesus gave the example, by washing the feet of the disciples.

This anguish alone, when one difficulty is added to another. We need Jesus\u2019 help, and this is why Jesus asks us to have faith in him, that is, to lean not on ourselves but on him. Because liberation from being troubled depends upon entrusting ourselves. Entrusting ourselves to Jesus, taking the \u201cleap\u201d. And this is liberation from feeling troubled. Jesus is risen and lives precisely to be always by our side. He took our humanity upon himself to carry it beyond death, to a new place, to Heaven, so that we might also be where he is. But how can we reach heaven? What is the way? Here is Jesus\u2019 decisive phrase. He says to us today: \u201cI am the Way\u201d (v. 6). Jesus is the way to go up to Heaven: to have a living relationship with him, to imitate him in love, to follow in his footsteps. (Regina Caeli, 10 May 2020)",

            "Brothers and sisters, this Word is a source of consolation, and it is a source of hope for us. Jesus did not separate himself from us, but rather opened the way for us, anticipating our final destination: the encounter with God the Father, in whose heart there is a place for each one of us. So, when we experience fatigue, bewilderment and even failure, let us remember where our life is headed. We must not lose sight of the destination, even if today we run the risk of overlooking it, of forgetting the final questions, the important ones: where are we going? Where are we headed? What is worth living for? Without these questions, we flatten our life only into the present. We think we must enjoy it as much as possible and end up living day by day, without purpose, without a goal. Instead, our homeland is in heaven (cf. Phil 3:20); let us not forget the greatness and the beauty of our destination!\nOnce we have discovered the destination, we too, like the apostle Thomas in today\u2019s Gospel, wonder: how can we get there? What is the way? At times, especially when there are major problems to face and there is the sensation that evil is stronger, we wonder: what should I do, what path should I follow? Let us listen to Jesus\u2019 answer: \u201cI am the way, and the truth, and the life\u201d (Jn 14:6). \u201cI am the way\u201d. Jesus himself is the way to follow to live in truth and to have life in abundance. He is the way and therefore faith in him is not a \u201cpackage of ideas\u201d in which to believe, but rather a road to be travelled, a journey to undertake, a path with him. It is following Jesus, because he is the way that leads to unfailing happiness. Following Jesus and imitating him, especially with gestures of closeness and mercy towards others. This is the compass for reaching Heaven: loving Jesus, the way, becoming signs of his love on earth. (Regina Caeli, 7 May 2023)"

Then, over time, things have worked out but in God\u2019s way, the divine way, not according to what we wanted in that moment. God\u2019s time is not our time. Lord, give me faith! May my faith grow! Ask for this grace, to have faith. Jesus, in the Gospel, says that faith moves mountains. But, having real faith. Jesus, before the faith of His poor, of his people, is won over; He feels special tenderness, before that faith. And He listens. (General Audience, 26 May 2021)",
            "The Father was always present in Jesus's life , and Jesus spoke about Him. Jesus prayed to the Father. And many times, He spoke about the Father who cares for us, as He cares for the birds, the lilies of the field\u2026 the Father. And when the disciples asked to learn how to pray, Jesus taught them to pray to the Father: \u201cOur Father\u201d (Mt 6:9). He always addresses the Father. But in this passage it is very strong; it is also as if He opened the doors of the omnipotence of prayer. \u201cBecause I am with the Father: ask me and I will do anything. Because the Father will do it with me\u201d (see Jn 14:11). This trust in the Father, trust in the Father who is capable of doing everything, this courage to pray, because it takes courage to pray! It takes the same courage, the same boldness it takes to preach: the same. (\u2026)\nPrayer must take first place. Then the other things. But when the other things take away space from prayer, then something is not right. And prayer is strong because of what we have heard in the Gospel of Jesus. It is \u201cbecause I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son\u201d (Jn 14:12-13). Thus the Church progresses in prayer, in the courage of prayer because the Church knows that without this ascent to the Father, she cannot survive. (Santa Marta, 10 May 2020)"

This remain is an active remaining, and it is also a mutual remaining. (\u2026) It is true, the branches without the vine cannot do anything because the sap would not get to them.

Brothers and sisters, if we think about it, our lives are filled with miracles. They are filled with deeds of love, signs of God\u2019s goodness.

This is the correct behaviour to have before God\u2019s works: to take a photograph of his works in our minds so that they may be impressed in our hearts, and then developed in our lives through many good deeds, so that this \u201cphotograph\u201d of God, who is love, becomes ever brighter in us and through us.

However, such cases are other loves; they are not of Jesus and are not of the Father. Christ asks us to abide in his love, which is the Father\u2019s love. Think about those other loves which distance us from Jesus\u2019 love, and also to reflect upon the existence of other measures of loving: such as half-hearted loving, which, however, is not loving.

Thus, this love of Christ is not like every other type of love, which can often be lukewarm or self-absorbed. Why does the Lord feel the need to remind us of these things?  The response is found in the text: \u201cthat my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full\u201d.

We can ask God everything, everything; explain everything, recount everything. It does not matter if we feel flawed in our relationship with God: we are not good friends, we are not grateful children, we are not faithful spouses. He continues to love us.

With that gesture in the Upper Room, Jesus foreshadows the mystery of the Cross. God is a faithful ally: if men and women cease to love him, he nevertheless continues to love, even if love leads him to Calvary.

It is the love that originates in the Father, because \u201cGod is love\u201d (1 Jn 4:8). This love of God, of the Father, flows like a river in his Son Jesus and through him comes to us, his creatures. Indeed, he says: \u201cAs the Father has loved me, so have I loved you\u201d (Jn 15:9). The love Jesus gives us is the same with which the Father loves him: pure unconditional love, freely given love. It cannot be bought, it is free. By giving it to us, Jesus treats us like friends \u2014 with this love \u2014, letting us know the Father; and he involves us in his same mission for the life of the world.\nAnd then, we can ask ourselves the question, how do we abide in this love? Jesus says: \u201cIf you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love\u201d (v. 10).

            "\u201cWhen the Paraclete comes, whom I will send to you from the Father\u2026\u201d (Jn 15:26). With these words, Jesus promises to send His disciples the Holy Spirit, the ultimate gift, the gift of gifts. He uses an unusual and mysterious word to describe the Spirit: Paraclete. Today let us reflect on this word, which is not easy to translate, for it has a number of meanings. Essentially, it means two things: Comforter and Advocate. [\u2026] The comforts of the world are like a pain reliever: they can give momentary relief, but not cure the illness we carry deep within. They can soothe us, but not heal us at the core. They work on the surface, on the level of the senses, but hardly touch our hearts. Only someone who makes us feel loved for who we are can give peace to our hearts. The Holy Spirit, the love of God, does precisely that. He comes down within us; as the Spirit, He acts in our spirit. He comes down \u201cwithin the heart\u201d, as \u201cthe soul\u2019s most welcome guest\u201d (ibid). He is the very love of God, who does not abandon us; for being present to those who are alone is itself a source of comfort. [\u2026] The Paraclete is also the Advocate. In Jesus\u2019 day, advocates did not do what they do today: rather than speaking in the place of defendants, they simply stood next to them and suggested arguments they could use in their own defence. That is what the Paraclete does, for He is \u201cthe Spirit of truth\u201d (v. 26). He does not take our place, but defends us from the deceits of evil by inspiring thoughts and feelings. He does so discreetly, without forcing us: He proposes but does not impose. (Homily solemnity of Pentecost, 23 May 2021)",

The Christian is always young: always. And when the Christian's heart begins to grow old, his vocation as a Christian begins to diminish. Either you are young at heart, young at soul, or you are not fully Christian. [...] This is youth. A youthfulness that makes you always look forward to hope: this, going forward! But to have this youthfulness requires a daily dialogue with the Holy Spirit, Who is always beside us. This is the great gift that Jesus left us: this support, which keeps you going forward. [...] Let us ask the Lord not to lose this renewed youthfulness, not to be \u201cretired\u201d Christians who have lost their joy and do not let themselves be carried forward ...

In this too, we see Jesus\u2019 love for us: his is a presence that does not want to limit our freedom. On the contrary, he leaves space to us, because true love always generates a closeness that does not stifle, is not possessive, is close but not possessive; Indeed, true love makes us protagonists. (\u2026)\nBrothers and sisters, let us think today of the gift of the Spirit we have received from Jesus to be witnesses of the Gospel. Let us ask ourselves if we really are; and also, if we are capable of loving others, leaving them free and making room for them. And then: do we know how to make ourselves intercessors for others, that is, do we know how to pray for them and bless their lives? Or do we serve others for our own interests? Let us learn this: intercessory prayer, interceding for the hopes and sufferings of the world, interceding for peace. And let us bless with our eyes and our words those we meet every day!

            "The Gospel of St John gives us part of the long farewell discourse pronounced by Jesus shortly before his Passion. In this discourse, he explains to the disciples the deepest truths about himself, and thus he outlines the relationship between Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit. Jesus knows that the fulfillment of the Father\u2019s plan is approaching and will be completed with his death and resurrection. Because of this he wants to assure his followers that he won\u2019t abandon them, because his mission will be prolonged by the Holy Spirit. It will be the Holy Spirit who continues the mission of Jesus, that is, guide the Church forward. Jesus reveals what this mission is. In the first place, the Spirit guides us to understand the many things that Jesus himself still had to say (cf. Jn 16:12). This doesn\u2019t refer to new or special doctrines, but to a full understanding of all that the Son has heard from the Father and has made known to the disciples (cf. v. 15). The Spirit guides us in new existential situations with a gaze fixed on Jesus and at the same time, open to events and to the future. He helps us to walk in history, firmly rooted in the Gospel and with dynamic fidelity to our traditions and customs. (Angelus, 22 May 2016)"

Are we not, instead, very often tempted to enclose the testimony of the Gospel in the cocoon of a \u2018sugar-coated\u2019 revelation, to which is added our own circumstantial veneration? This attitude, which seems respectful, actually distances us from the real Jesus, and even becomes the occasion for a very abstract, very self-referential, very worldly journey of faith, which is not the path of Jesus. Jesus is the Word of God made man, and He comports Himself as man, He speaks to us as man, God-man.(\u2026) And when we want to insert ourselves into other people\u2019s lives, Jesus answers, \u201cWhat is that to you?

At this point, Jesus invited them not to hinder those who do good, because they contribute to the fulfilment of God\u2019s plan (cf. Mk 9:38-41).

But this way, they end up feeling that they are privileged and consider others as outsiders, to the extent of becoming hostile towards them.

He tempts by using cunning, and it can happen as with those disciples, who ended up excluding even someone who had cast out the devil himself! Sometimes we too, instead of being humble and open communities, can give the impression of being the \u201ctop of the class\u201d and keep others at a distance; instead of trying to walk with everyone, we can show off our \u201cbeliever\u2019s license\u201d: \u201cI am a believer\u201d, \u201cI am Catholic\u201d, \u201cI belong to this association, to that one\u201d, and the others, poor things, do not. This is a sin. Showing off one\u2019s \u201cbeliever\u2019s license\u201d to judge and exclude.

It is always given with love! There is no truth without love. Love is the first truth. If there is no love, there is no truth. They want truth enslaved to their interests. There is a love, of sorts: it is love of self, love for oneself. That narcissist idolatry that leads them to betray others, that leads them to abuse of trust. (\u2026)The meekness that Jesus wants us to have, has nothing, has nothing of this adulation, this sickly sweet way of going on. Nothing! Meekness is simple, it is like that of a child, who is not hypocritical, because it is not corrupt. (Santa Marta, June 4, 2018)",

And this is dangerous because it initiates a series of scoldings, a series of resentments. How often, unfortunately, do conflicts originate and grow within the domestic walls due to prolonged periods of silence and unchecked selfishness! Sometimes it even ends up in physical and moral violence. This lacerates harmony and kills the family. Let us convert ourselves from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cyou\u201d. What must be most important in a family is \u201cyou\u201d.

They fall into that delirium of omnipotence that pollutes everything and destroys harmony. We too feel it inside of us, all of us.

We all are in need of help, of love and of forgiveness! Children remind us of another beautiful thing: they remind us that we are always sons and daughters. Even if one becomes an adult, or an elderly person, even if one becomes a parent, if one occupies a position of responsibility, underneath all of this is still the identity of a child. We are all sons and daughters. And this always brings us back to the fact that we did not give ourselves life but that we received it. (General Audience, March 18, 2015)",

For this purpose \u2014 St Paul states \u2014 love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us (cf. Rom 5:5). This is also the love which is given to spouses in the Sacrament of Marriage. It is love that nourishes their relationship, through joy and pain, untroubled and difficult moments. It is love that gives rise to the desire to bear children, to await them, welcome them, raise them, teach them. It is the same love which, in today\u2019s Gospel, Jesus shows toward children: \u201cLet the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God\u201d (Mk 10:14).

The courage to approach the Lord, to be open to the Lord,  to not fear the Lord: I thank this child for the lesson he has given us all.

Children do not have an automatic translator from the heart to life: the heart takes the lead. (General Audience, 20 October 2021)",
            "Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it\u201d (Mk 10:15). Here is what is new: the disciple must not only serve the little ones, but also acknowledge himself as a little one. (\u2026) It is the first step in opening ourselves up to him. Often, however, we forget about this. In prosperity, in well-being, we have the illusion of being self-sufficient, that we suffice to ourselves, that we do not need God. (\u2026) this is a deception, because each one of us is a person in need, a little one. We must seek out our own smallness and recognise it. And there, we will find Jesus.\nIn life, recognising oneself as little, is a starting point for growing. If we think about it, we grow, not so much on the basis of our successes and the things we have, but above all in difficult and fragile moments. There, in our need, we mature; there we open our hearts to God, to others, to the meaning of life. Let us open our eyes to others. Let us open our eyes, when we are little, to the true meaning of life. When we feel small in the face of a problem, small in front of a cross, an illness, when we experience fatigue and loneliness, let us not be discouraged. The mask of superficiality is falling away and our radical fragility is re-emerging: it is our common ground, our treasure, because with God frailty is not an obstacle but an opportunity. This would be a beautiful prayer: \u201cLord, look at my frailties\u2026\u201d and list them before him. This is a good attitude before God. (\u2026) Those who pray with perseverance know this well: in dark or lonely moments, God\u2019s tenderness towards us makes itself, so to speak, even more present. When we are little, we feel God\u2019s tenderness more.  (Angelus, 3 October 2021)"

He is not an isolated God; He is a \u2018God-with\u2019. In particular, with us, namely, with human beings. Our God is not an absent God, confined to a far-off heaven; he is instead a God \u201cimpassioned\u201d with man, so tenderly in love as to be incapable of being separated from him.

The Lord\u2019s final encounter with his followers takes place here, on the mountain. The \u201cmountain\u201d has a strong symbolic and evocative charge. Jesus proclaimed the Beatitudes on the Mount (cf. Mt 5:1-12); He withdrew to the mountains to pray (cf. Mt 14:23). He welcomed the crowds there and healed the sick (cf. Mt 15:29). However this time on the mountain, he is no longer the Master who acts and teaches, but rather the Risen One who asks the disciples to take action and to proclaim, entrusting to them the mandate to continue his work.\nHe assigns to them the mission to all the peoples. He says: \u201cGo, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you\u201d (vv. 19-20).

Faced with such a demanding task, and thinking of our weaknesses, we feel inadequate, as the Apostles themselves surely felt.

In the Church there are climbers, and there are lots of them. It would be better for them to go north and become mountain climbers! It\u2019s healthier! But don\u2019t come to Church to climb!.

Two of his disciples break away from the others: James and John. They approach Jesus and tell him what they want: \u201cGrant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory\u201d. They want to take a different road. Not Jesus\u2019 road, but a different one. The road of those who, perhaps even without realizing it, \u201cuse\u201d the Lord for their own advancement.

            "The way of service is the most effective antidote against the disease of seeking first place; it is the medicine for status seekers, this seeking first place, which infects many human contexts, and does not even spare Christians, the People of God, nor even the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Therefore, as disciples of Christ, let us receive this Gospel passage as a call to conversion, in order to witness with courage and generosity a Church that bows at the feet of the least, in order to serve them with love and simplicity. May the Virgin Mary, who fully and humbly adhered to the will of God, help us to joyfully follow Jesus on the way of service, the royal road that leads to Heaven. (Angelus, 21 October 2018)"

We would like to have all of this happen today in our homes too. Celebrating Mary Most Holy Assumed into Heaven, we would once again wish her to bring to us, to our families, to our communities, this immense gift, that unique Grace that we must always seek first and above all the other graces that we also have at heart: the grace that is Jesus Christ! By bearing Jesus, Our Lady also brings to us a new joy full of meaning; she brings us a new ability to traverse with faith the most painful and difficult moments; she brings us the capacity of mercy, in order to forgive each other, to understand each other and to support each other.

            "Today, the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, we contemplate her who was taken up body and soul to the glory of Heaven. Today\u2019s Gospel also presents her to us as she goes up, this time \u201cinto the hill country\u201d (Lk 1:39). And why does she go up there? To help her cousin Elizabeth, and there she proclaims the joyful canticle of the Magnificat. Mary goes up and the Word of God reveals to us what characterizes her as she is lifted: service to neighbour and praise to God. Both of these things: Mary is the woman of service to neighbour, and Mary is the woman who praises God. (\u2026) It is when we stoop to serve our brothers and sisters that we rise. It is love that elevates life. We go to serve our brothers and sisters and with this service, we \u201crise\u201d. But to serve is not easy: Our Lady, who had just conceived, travels almost 150 kilometres from Nazareth to reach Elizabeth\u2019s house. To help is costly, for all of us! (\u2026) But service risks being fruitless without praise to God. Indeed, when Mary enters the home of her cousin, she praises the Lord. She does not talk about her weariness from the journey, but rather a song of jubilation springs from her heart. Because those who love God know how to praise. And today\u2019s Gospel shows us \u201ca cascade of praise: the child who leaps with joy in Elizabeth\u2019s womb (cf. Lk 1:44); Elizabeth who utters words of blessing and \u201cthe first beatitude\u201d: \u201cBlessed is she who believed\u201d (Lk 1:45); and everything culminates in Mary, who proclaims the Magnificat (cf. Lk 1:46-55). Praise increases joy. Praise is like a ladder: it leads hearts upwards. (Angelus, 15 August 2023)"

He gives us the courage to go outside of ourselves and bend down with love toward the fragility of others. As God does with us. This is the logic of the Eucharist: we receive Jesus who loves us and heals our fragilities in order to love others and help them in their fragilities; and this lasts our entire life. In the Liturgy of the Hours today, we prayed a hymn: four verses that are the summary of Jesus\u2019 entire life. And they tell us this: as Jesus was born, he became our travelling companion in life. Then, at the supper he gave himself as food. Then, on the cross, in his death, he became the \u201cprice\u201d; he paid for us. And now, as he reigns in Heaven he is our reward; we go to seek the One who awaits us. May the Blessed Virgin, in whom God became flesh, help us to embrace the Eucharist with a grateful heart and to make a gift of our life too. May the Eucharist make us a gift for all others.

            "This narrative allegorically illustrates the reproaches of the prophets in the story of Israel. It is a history that belongs to us. It is about the Covenant which God wished to establish with mankind and in which he also called us to participate. Like any other love story, this story of the Covenant has its positive moments too, but it is also marked by betrayal and rejection. (\u2026) The urgency of replying with good fruits to the call of the Lord, who asks us to become his vineyard, helps us understand what is new and original about the Christian faith. It is not so much the sum of precepts and moral norms but rather, it is first and foremost a proposal of love which God makes through Jesus and continues to make with mankind. It is an invitation to enter into this love story, by becoming a lively and open vine, rich in fruits and hope for everyone. A closed vineyard can become wild and produce wild grapes. We are called to leave this vineyard to put ourselves at the service of our brothers and sisters who are not with us, in order to shake each other and encourage each other, to remind ourselves that we must be the Lord\u2019s vineyard in every environment, even the more distant and challenging ones. (Angelus, 8 October 2017)",
            "The image of the vineyard is clear: it represents the people whom the Lord has chosen and formed with such care; the servants sent by the landowner are the prophets, sent by God, while the son represents Jesus. And just as the prophets were rejected, so too Christ was rejected and killed. (\u2026)\nWith this very harsh parable, Jesus confronts his interlocutors with their responsibility, and he does so with extreme clarity. But let us not think that this admonition applies only to those who rejected Jesus at that time. It applies to all times, including our own. Even today God awaits the fruits of his vineyard from those he has sent to work in it. All of us.\nIn any age, those who have authority, any authority, also in the Church, in the People of God, may be tempted to work in their own interests instead of those of God. And Jesus says that true authority is when one performs service; it is in serving, not exploiting others. The vineyard is the Lord\u2019s, not ours. Authority is a service, and as such should be exercised for the good of all and for the dissemination of the Gospel. (Angelus, 4 October 2020)"

This is a doubt that touches mankind of every age and also us: after this earthly pilgrimage, what will become of our life? Will it belong to nothing, to death?

And it is moving. In today\u2019s haste, in the midst of a thousand errands and continuous worries, we are losing the capacity to be moved and to feel compassion, because we are losing this return to the heart, that is, this memory, this return to the heart. Without memory one loses one\u2019s roots, and without roots, one does not grow. It is good for us to nurture the memory of who has loved us, cared for us, and lifted us up. (\u2026) I wonder: how does our memory work? To simplify, we could say that we remember someone or something when it touches our heart, when it binds us to a particular affection or lack of affection.

But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. So one who blasphemes about this, blasphemes the foundation of God\u2019s love, which is redemption, the re-creation; blasphemes the priesthood of Christ. But what wrong does the Lord not forgive? The Lord forgives everything, but whoever says these things has no forgiveness, doesn\u2019t want to be forgiven, doesn\u2019t allow himself to be forgiven. And this is the terrible thing about blaspheming the Holy Spirit: not allowing oneself to be forgiven, because it denies the priestly anointing of Jesus through the Holy Spirit.

            "Jesus reacted with firm and clear words; he did not tolerate this, because those scribes, perhaps without realizing it, were falling into the gravest sin: denying and blaspheming against God\u2019s Love which is present and active in Jesus. And blasphemy, the sin against the Holy Spirit, is the one unforgivable sin \u2014 as Jesus said \u2014 because it comes from closing the heart to God\u2019s mercy which acts in Jesus. But this episode contains an admonishment which is useful to all of us. Indeed, it can happen that deep envy of a person\u2019s goodness and good works can drive one to falsely accuse him or her. Here there is true, lethal poison: the malice with which, in a premeditated manner, one wants to destroy the good reputation of the other. May God free us from this terrible temptation! And if, by examining our conscience, we realize that this weed is sprouting within us, let us go straight away to confess it in the Sacrament of Penance, before it grows and produces its evil effects, which are incurable. Be careful, because this attitude destroys families, friendships, communities and even society. (Angelus, 10 June 2018)"

            "Evangelical preaching flows from gratuitousness, from the wonder of the salvation that comes and that which I have freely received I must freely give. This is what they were like at the beginning. St. Peter did not have a bank account, and when he had to pay taxes, the Lord sent him to the sea to catch fish and find the money in the fish, to pay. (\u2026) Everything is grace. Everything. And what are the signs of when an apostle lives this gratuity? There are so many, but I will underline only two: First, poverty. The proclamation of the Gospel must follow the path of poverty. The testimony of this poverty: I have no wealth, my wealth is the gift I received, God: this gratuity is our wealth! (\u2026) The works of the Church must be brought forward, and some are a little complex, but with a heart of poverty, not with the heart of an investment broker or an entrepreneur\u2026\" \"These two are the signs of an apostle who lives this gratuity: poverty and the ability to praise the Lord. And when we find the apostles who want to build a rich Church and a Church without the gratuitousness of praise, the Church becomes old, the Church becomes an NGO, the Church becomes lifeless. Today we ask the Lord for the grace to acknowledge this generosity: 'Freely you have received, freely give'. Recognizing this gratuity, this gift of God .

But what does the word \u201cblessed\u201d mean? The original term does not mean one with a full belly or one who is doing well, but rather it is a person who is in a condition of grace, who progresses in God\u2019s grace and progresses on God\u2019s path: patience, poverty, service to others, comfort.... Those who advance in these things are happy and shall be blessed. In order to give himself to us, God often chooses unthinkable paths, perhaps the path of our limitations, of our tears, of our defeats. It is the paschal joy of which our Oriental brothers and sisters speak, the one that has the stigmata but is alive, has been through death and has experienced the Power of God.

            "Before oneself, everyone knows well that, as much as one does one\u2019s best, he/she remains radically incomplete and vulnerable. There is no trick to cover up this vulnerability. Each of us is vulnerable inside. One has to see where. Jesus Christ tells us: being poor is an opportunity for grace; and he shows us the way out from this difficulty. The Kingdom of God belongs to the poor in spirit. There are those who have kingdoms in this world, they have goods and comforts. But we know how they end. Only those who know how to love what is truly good more than themselves, reign. And this is the power of God. (General Audience, 5 February 2020)",
            "This (\u2026) liturgy leads us to meditate on the Beatitudes (cf. Mt 5:1-12) which open up the great so-called Sermon on the Mount, the \u201cMagna Carta\u201d of the New Testament. Jesus manifests God\u2019s desire to lead men to happiness. This message was already present in the preaching of the prophets: God is close to the poor and the oppressed, and delivers them from those who mistreat them. But in this preaching of his, Jesus follows a particular path: he starts with the word \u201cblessed\u201d, that is, happy. He continues with the indication of the condition to be so; and he concludes by making a promise. The cause of blessedness, that is, of happiness, lies not in the requisite condition \u2014 for example, \u201cpoor in spirit\u201d, \u201cmourning\u201d, \u201chungry for righteousness\u201d, \u201cpersecuted\u201d \u2014 but in the subsequent promise, to be welcomed with faith as a gift of God. One starts from a condition of hardship in order to open oneself to God\u2019s gift and enter the new world, the \u201cKingdom\u201d announced by Jesus. This is not an automatic mechanism, but a way of life in following the Lord, through which the reality of hardship and affliction is seen in a new perspective and experienced according to the conversion that comes about. One is not blessed if one is not converted, capable of appreciating and living God\u2019s gifts. (Angelus, 29 January 2017)"

No! That is not the correct path\u2026 I make a promise, in order to expand my heart to receive what is already there, waiting for us free of charge. This relationship of gratuitousness with God is what will help us to have the same rapport with others, whether it be in Christian witness, Christian service, or the pastoral work of those who guide the people of God. We do so along the way. Christian life means walking. Preach and serve, but do not make use of others. Serve and give freely that which you have received freely. (Santa Marta, 11 June 2019)"

We can do everything, everything, with the grace of God! Indeed,  holiness is none other than guarding God\u2019s freely given  grace. (Angelus, 16 February 2020)",
            "Christian life is to serve. It is very sad, to see Christians who at the start of their conversion or of their awareness of being Christian, serve, are open to service; they serve the People of God, but then wind up using them instead. This does great harm to the People of God.  Our vocation is to \u2018serve\u2019, not to \u2018make use of\u2019.\u201d When we say \u2018Our Father\u2019 and we pray, we open our heart, allowing this gratuitousness to enter. Often when we need some spiritual grace, we say: \u2018Well, now I will fast, do penance, pray a novena\u2026\u2019 Fine, but be careful: this is not done to \u2018pay\u2019 or \u2018buy\u2019 grace. We do it to open our hearts so that grace might enter. Grace is freely given.\u201d This relationship of gratuitousness with God is what will help us to have the same rapport with others, whether it be in Christian witness, Christian service, or the pastoral work of those who guide the people of God. (Santa Marta 11 Giugno 2019)",
            " \u201cSimply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil\u201d (Mt 5:37). Half-truths, double-talk intended to deceive one\u2019s neighbour, the reticence that conceals true intentions, are not attitudes in keeping with justice. The righteous person is upright, simple and straightforward. He does not wear masks, he presents himself for what he is and he speaks the truth. The words \u201cthank you\u201d are often on his lips. He knows that no matter how generous we strive to be, we always remain indebted to our neighbour. If we love, it is also because we were loved first.\nIn tradition we can find countless descriptions of the righteous person. Let us look at some of them. The righteous person reveres laws and respects them, knowing that they constitute a barrier protecting the defenceless from the tyranny of the powerful. The righteous person does not only think of his own individual well-being, but desires the good of society as a whole. Therefore, he does not give in to the temptation to think only of himself and of taking care of his own affairs, however legitimate they may be, as if they were the only thing that exists in the world. (\u2026) Furthermore, the righteous person shuns harmful behaviour such as slander, perjury, fraud, usury, mockery and dishonesty. The righteous person keeps his word, returns what he has borrowed, pays fair wages to all labourers: a man who does not pay fair wages to workers is not just, he is unjust. (\u2026)\nNone of us knows if the righteous people in our world are numerous or if they are as rare as precious pearls. But they are people who draw grace and blessings both upon themselves and upon the world in which they live. They are not losers compared to those who are \u201ccunning and shrewd\u201d, for, as Scripture says, \u201cHe who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life and honour\u201d (Pr 21:21). The righteous are not moralists who don the robe of the censor, but upright people who \u201chunger and thirst for righteousness\u201d (Mt 5:6). (General audience, 3 April 2024)"

            "In the language of the Gospel, the seed is the symbol of the Word of God. God has entrusted his Word to our earth, that is to each one of us with our concrete humanity. This Word, if accepted, certainly bears fruit, for God Himself makes it sprout and grow in ways that we cannot always verify or understand. The Word of God makes things grow, it gives life. And here, I would like to remind you once again, of the importance of having the Gospel, the Bible, close at hand. A small Gospel in your purse, in your pocket and to nourish yourselves every day with this living Word of God. Read a passage from the Gospel every day, a passage from the Bible. Please don\u2019t ever forget this. Because this is the power that makes the life of the Kingdom of God sprout within us. And thus is the Kingdom of God: a humanly small and seemingly irrelevant reality. To become a part of it, one must be poor of heart; not trusting in their own abilities, but in the power of the love of God. (Angelus, 14 june 2015)",

Man is his humble collaborator, who contemplates and rejoices in divine creative action and waits patiently for its fruits. (Angelus, 14 June 2015)",

            "At times history, with its events and its protagonists, seems to go in the opposite direction of the design of the heavenly Father, who wants justice, fraternity and peace for all his children. But we are called to live out these periods as seasons of trial, of hope and of vigilant expectation of the harvest. Indeed, yesterday like today, the Kingdom of God grows in the world in a mysterious way, in a surprising way, revealing the hidden power of the little seed, its victorious vitality. Within the folds of personal and social events which at times seem to signal the failure of hope, it is important to remain confident in God\u2019s subdued but powerful way of acting. For this reason, in moments of darkness and of difficulty we must not lose heart, but remain anchored in faithfulness to God, to his ever-saving presence. Remember this: God always saves. He is the Saviour. (Angelus, 17 June 2018)",
            "Today Jesus compares the Kingdom of God, that is, his presence that dwells in the heart of things and of the world, to the mustard seed, that is, to the smallest seed there is: it is really tiny. Yet, cast upon the ground, it grows until becoming the tallest tree (cf. Mk 4:31-32). This is what God does. At times, the din of the world, along with the many activities that fill our days, prevent us from stopping and seeing how the Lord is conducting history. Yet \u2014 the Gospel assures us \u2014 God is at work, like a good little seed that silently and slowly germinates. (\u2026) Good, let us remember, always grows in a humble way, in a hidden, often invisible way. (Angelus, 13 June 2021)",
            "In sending out the 72 disciples, Jesus gives them precise instructions which express the characteristics of the mission. The first, as we have already seen, is: pray; the second: go; and then: carry no purse, no bag...; say, \u2018Peace be to this house\u2019 ... remain in the same house... do not go from house to house... heal the sick in it and say to them, \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you\u2019\u201d. And if they do not receive you, go out into the streets and take your leave (cf. vv. 2-10). These imperatives show that the mission is based on prayer; that it is itinerant: it is not idle; it is itinerant; that it requires separation and poverty; that it brings peace and healing, signs of the closeness of the Kingdom of God; that it is not proselytism but proclamation and witness; and that it also requires frankness and the evangelical freedom to leave while highlighting the responsibility of having rejected the message of salvation, but without condemnation and cursing.\nIf lived in these terms, the mission of the Church will be characterized by joy. And how does this passage end? The 72 \u201creturned with joy\u201d (cf. v. 17). It is not an ephemeral joy, which flows from the success of the mission; on the contrary, it is a joy rooted in the promise that \u2014 as Jesus says: \u201cyour names are written in heaven\u201d (v. 20). With this expression he means inner joy, and the indestructible joy that is born out of the awareness of being called by God to follow his Son. That is, the joy of being his disciples. (Angelus, 7 July 2019)",
            "Jesus compares the Kingdom of God to a mustard seed. It is a very small seed, yet it grows to become the greatest of all the plants in the garden: an unforeseeable, surprising growth. It is not easy for us to enter this logic of the unforeseeable nature of God and to accept it in our life. But today the Lord exhorts us to an attitude of faith which exceeds all our plans, our calculations, our predictions. God is always the God of surprises. The Lord always surprises us. It is an invitation to open ourselves more generously to God\u2019s plans, both on the personal level and on that of the community. In our communities it is important to pay attention to the little and big occasions of goodness that the Lord offers us, allowing ourselves to engage in his dynamics of love, of welcoming and of mercy toward others.\nThe authenticity of the Church\u2019s mission does not come through success nor through the gratification of the results, but by going forth with the courage of trust and the humility of abandonment to God. Going forth professing Jesus and with the power of the Holy Spirit. It is the awareness of being small and weak instruments which, in God\u2019s hands and with his grace, can accomplish great deeds, advancing his Kingdom which is \u201crighteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\u201d (Rom 14:17).

He does not insult him, no: he says to the guard, \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?\u201d (Jn 18:23). He asks for an account of the wrong done to him. Turning the other cheek does not mean suffering in silence, giving in to injustice. With his question, Jesus denounces what is unjust. But he does so without anger, without violence, indeed with kindness. He does not wish to spark off an argument, but rather to defuse resentment, this is important: to extinguish hatred and injustice together, seeking to restore the guilty brother.

He gives a few examples of this: turn the other cheek, give up your coat or money, accept other sacrifices (v. 39-42). But such sacrifice does not mean that the demands of justice should be ignored or contradicted. No, on the contrary, Christian love, which manifests itself in a special way in mercy, is an achievement superior to justice.

Finally, Lent invites us to look inside our heart, with fasting, which frees us from attachment to things and from the worldliness that numbs the heart.

Consequently, the Lord rendered him mute for the entire gestation period (cf. v. 20). It was a sign. But God does not rely on our reasoning and our limited human abilities.

This means that the measuring stick is Jesus and his Gospel \u2014 not what we think, but what he says to us. And so, we are talking about a narrow door not because only a few are destined to go through it, no, but because to belong to Christ means to follow him, to commit one\u2019s life to love, in service and in giving oneself as he did, who passed through the narrow door of the cross. Let\u2019s think, to be concrete, about those daily acts of love we struggle to carry out: let\u2019s think of parents who dedicate themselves to their children, making sacrifices and renouncing time for themselves; of those who concern themselves with others and not only with their own interests \u2014 how many people are good like this; let\u2019s think of those who spend themselves in service to the elderly, to the poorest and most vulnerable; let\u2019s think of those who keep on working, with commitment, putting up with discomfort and, perhaps, with misunderstanding; let\u2019s think of those who suffer because of their faith, but who continue to pray and love; let\u2019s think of those who, rather than following their own instincts, respond to evil with good, finding the strength to forgive and the courage to begin again.

This is precisely the reason why the constant work of discernment is so needed, in order to understand what is truly of the Lord. (Santa Marta, Jan 7, 2014)\n ",
            "This too we learn from our father Abraham: complaining to the Lord is a way of praying. Sometimes I hear, during confession: \"I have complained to the Lord ...\", and [I answer]: \"But no! regrets, He is a father!\". And this is a way of praying: complain to the Lord, this is good. Abram said, \u201cBehold, thou hast given me no offspring; and a slave born in my house will be my heir.\u201d And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, \u201cThis man shall not be your heir; your own son shall be your heir.\u201d And he brought him outside and said, \u201cLook toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.\u201d Then he said to him, \u201cSo shall your descendants be.\u201d (General Audience, 28 December 2016)",

Indeed, those who are good draw good from their hearts and their mouths, and those who are bad draw bad, by practicing the most damaging exercise among us, which is grumbling, gossiping, speaking ill of others. This destroys. It destroys the family, destroys school, destroys the workplace, destroys the neighbourhood. Wars begin from the tongue. Let us consider a bit this lesson of Jesus and ask ourselves the question: do I speak ill of others? Do I always seek to tarnish others? Is it easier for me to see others\u2019 flaws than my own? And let us try to correct ourselves at least a little: it will do us all good. (Angelus 3 March 2019)",

These are \u201cpseudo-christians, pseudo-pastors\u201d, who \u201cdo good things\u201d but \u201cthe rock is missing\u201d. There are, \u201cthree key words to understanding this: speak, do, and listen\u201d. One who simply speaks and acts, is not a true prophet, is not a true Christian, and in the end everything will fall\u201d, because \u201cit is not on the rock of God\u2019s love, it is not \u2018made of stone\u2019\u201d. On the other hand, \u201cone who knows how to listen and from listening, does, with the strength of the word of another, not her own\u201d, this one \u201cremains firm like the rock: although she is a humble person, who doesn\u2019t seem important\u201d, she is great.

            "When Jesus warns people to beware of 'false prophets', he says: 'By their fruits ye shall know them'.

In this way Jesus pointed out to us, his disciples, that our mission in the world cannot be static, but is itinerant. The Christian is itinerant.

With these deliberately provocative words, he intends to emphasize the primacy of following and of proclaiming the Kingdom of God, even over and above the most important realities, such as the family. The urgency of communicating the Gospel, which breaks the chains of death and ushers in eternal life, does not permit delays but requires promptness and complete willingness.

But he did not say: \u201cit\u2019s true, the Lord is risen\u201d. No! He went further; he said: \u201cMy Lord and my God\u201d. Starting with his disbelief the Lord led him to profess not only his belief in the Resurrection, but above all, his belief in the divinity of the Lord. And he worshipped. (Santa Marta, 3 July 2013)",

Indeed, it is not always easy to believe, especially when, as in his case, one has suffered a tremendous disappointment. After a huge disappoint, it is difficult to believe. He had followed Jesus for years, running risks and enduring discomforts. But the Teacher was put on a cross like a criminal, and no one freed him. No one did anything! He is dead and everyone is afraid. How can he trust again? How can he trust the news saying He is alive? There was doubt inside him. Thomas, however, shows that he is courageous. While the others are closed up inside the Upper Room out of fear, he goes out, running the risk that someone might recognize, report and arrest him. We could even think that, with his courage, he would have deserved more than the others to meet the Risen Lord. Instead, precisely because he is away, Thomas is not there when Jesus appears to the disciples for the first time, on Easter evening, thus missing that opportunity. He had distanced himself from the community. How could he get [the opportunity] back? Only by going back to the others, returning there, to that family he had left behind, scared and sad. When he does so, when he returns, they tell him that Jesus had come, but he struggles to believe. He wants to see his wounds. And Jesus satisfies him: eight days later, he appears again in the midst of his disciples and shows them his wounds, his hands, his feet, these wounds that are the proof of his love, that are the ever-open channels of his mercy.

And he says this to us as well. That is where you will find me; that is where I will show you the signs of the wounds impressed on my body: the signs of the Love that overcomes hatred, of the Pardon that disarms revenge, the signs of the Life that conquers death. It is there, in the community, that you will discover my face, as you share moments of doubt and fear with your brothers and sisters, clinging even more strongly to them. Without the community, it is difficult to find Jesus. (Regina Caeli, 16 April 2023)"

It is enough to respond to the call with a humble and sincere heart. The Church is not a community of perfect people, but of disciples on a journey, who follow the Lord because they know they are sinners and in need of his pardon. (General audience, 13 April 2016)",
            "Matthew was sitting at the tax office; Jesus said to him: \u201cFollow me\u201d. And \u201che rose and followed him\u201d (v. 9). We note that the text emphasizes that \u201che rose\u201d. Why is this detail so important? Because in those days he who was seated had authority over the others who stood before him to listen to him or, as in that case, to pay taxes. He who sat, in short, had power. The first thing Jesus does is to detach Matthew from power: from sitting to receive others, He sets him in motion towards others, not receiving, no: he goes out to others. He makes him leave a position of supremacy in order to put him on an equal footing with his brothers and sisters, and open to him the horizons of service. This is what he does, and this is fundamental for Christians. Do we, disciples of Jesus, we, Church, sit around waiting for people to come, or do we know how to get up, to set out with others, to seek others? Saying, \u201cBut let them come to me, I am here, let them come\u201d, is a non-Christian position. No, you go to seek them out, you take the first step. (\u2026) After getting up and following Jesus, where will Matthew go? We might imagine that, having changed the man\u2019s life, the Master would lead him to new encounters, new spiritual experiences. No, or at least not immediately. (\u2026) Matthew returns to his environment, but he returns there changed and with Jesus. His apostolic zeal does not begin in a new, pure place, an ideal place, far away, but instead he begins there where he lives, with the people he knows. Here is the message for us: we do not have to wait until we are perfect and have come a long way following Jesus to bear witness to him, no. Our proclamation begins today, there where we live. (General Audience, 11 January 2023)",
            "Few people saw Matthew as he was: they knew him as the one who was \u201csitting at the tax office\u201d (v. 9). He was, in fact, a tax collector: that is, someone who collected taxes on behalf of the Roman empire that occupied Palestine. In other words, he was a collaborator, a traitor to the people. We can imagine the contempt the people felt for him: he was a \u201cpublican\u201d, as they were called. But in the eyes of Jesus, Matthew is a man, with both his miseries and his greatness. Be aware of this: Jesus does not stop at the adjective \u2014 Jesus always seeks out the noun. \u201cThis person is a sinner, he\u2019s that kind of person\u2026\u201d these are adjectives: Jesus goes to the person, to the heart, \u201cThis is a person, this is a man, this is a woman\u201d. (\u2026) This gaze  of Jesus that sees the other, whoever he may be as the recipient of love, is really beautiful and it is the beginning of evangelizing passion. Everything starts from this gaze, which we learn from Jesus. (\u2026) We can ask ourselves: what is our gaze like towards others? (General Audience, 11 January 2023)"

For this reason, at the end of the Gospel, when they bring the wine, when he speaks of wine, it makes me think of the wedding at Cana \u2013 and for this reason Jesus works His miracle \u2013 this is why Our Lady, when she realized that there was no more wine\u2026 but if there is no wine there is no party ... imagining that the wedding feast might therefore end with the drinking of tea or juice: it would not do ... it is a feast, and Our Lady asks for the miracle. Such is the Christian life. The Christian life has this joyfulness of spirit, a joyfulness of heart. \u201c (Santa Marta, 6 September 2013)",

However, these doctors of the law were locked up in their commandments, in their rules. So much that St Paul, speaking about them, tells us that before faith came \u2014 that is, Jesus \u2014 we were all held as prisoners under the law. But this law was not cruel: held but as prisoners, waiting for faith to come. Indeed, that faith which would be revealed in Jesus himself. (Santa Marta, 5 Sept 2014)",

(\u2026) \u201cOne of you may tell me: but father, don\u2019t Christians have laws? Yes! Jesus said: I have not come to abolish the law but to fulfil it\u201d.

And get new wineskins, those of the Gospel\u201d. \u201cIt is not possible to understand the mentality, for example, of these doctors of the law, these Pharisee theologians, with the spirit of the Gospel. They are different things\u201d. In fact, \u201cthe Gospel\u2019s approach is a different approach, which leads to the fulfillment of the law\u201d.

They did not know the reason and they thought it was scandalous that the immensity of God should be revealed in the smallness of our flesh, that the Son of God should be the son of a carpenter, that the divine should be hidden in the human, that God should inhabit a face, the words, the gestures of a simple man. This is the scandal: the incarnation of God, his concreteness, his \u2018daily life\u2019.

These are the two requirements in order to be healed, in order to have access to his heart: to feel in need of healing and to entrust yourself to Him.

If compassion is the language of God, so often human language is that of indifference. We must ask ourselves: \u201cHow many times do we look away...?  By doing so we close the door to compassion.

Therefore it is the task of Christians to spread the redeeming power throughout the world, becoming missionaries and heralds of the Word of God. Always remember that the Gospel has the power to change lives! Do not forget this. (Angelus, 1 February 2015)",
            "Jesus\u2019 disciples do not find their joy in money, power, or other material goods; but in the gifts they receive every day from God: life, creation, brothers and sisters, and so on. These are gifts of life. They are content to share even the goods they possess, because they live according to the logic of God. And what is the logic of God? Gratuitousness. The disciple has learned to live in gratuitousness. This poverty is also an attitude towards the meaning of life, because Jesus\u2019 disciples do not think they possess it, that they already know everything, but rather they know they must learn every day. And this is poverty: the awareness of having to learn every day. Because they have this attitude, Jesus\u2019 disciples are humble, open people, far from prejudice and inflexibility.

Jesus \u2013 as we heard \u2013 called each of them by name. He looked them in the eye, and they in turn gazed at his face, listened to his voice and beheld his miracles.

And this is not secondary, a disciple must also take this journey because if he doesn\u2019t always seek God, the Gospel he brings to others will be a weak Gospel, watered down, powerless.\nIf a disciple does not walk in order to serve, his walking is of no use.

Where, is the service to Jesus in the sick, in the imprisoned, in the hungry, in the naked? And this is precisely what Jesus told us we must do because he is there.

A baptized person who does not feel the need to proclaim the Gospel, to proclaim Jesus, is not a good Christian. The second characteristic of the missionary\u2019s style is, so to speak, a face, which consists in the poverty of means.

They do it out of love, simply to serve. Gratitude, appreciation is, first of all, good manners, but it is also a characteristic of a Christian.

There is no Christian mission marked by tranquility! Difficulties and tribulations are part of the work of evangelization and we are called to find in them the opportunity to test the authenticity of our faith and of our relationship with Jesus. We must consider these difficulties as the opportunity to be even more missionary and to grow in that trust toward God, our Father who does not abandon his children during the storm.\nEven in our day, brothers and sisters, persecution against Christians is present.\nTheir example helps us not to hesitate in taking the position in favour of Christ, bearing witness bravely in everyday situations.\nBesides sending us out as \u201csheep in the midst of wolves\u201d, the Lord even in our times sends us out as sentinels in the midst of people who do not want to be woken from their worldly lethargy which ignores the Gospel\u2019s words of Truth, building for themselves their own ephemeral truths.

Hostility is always at the beginning of persecutions of Christians; because Jesus knows that the mission is blocked by the work of evil. For this reason, the laborer of the Gospel will strive to be free from every kind of human conditioning, carrying neither purse nor bag nor sandals (cf. v. 4), as Jesus counseled, so as to place reliance solely in the power of the Cross of Jesus Christ. This means abandoning every motive of personal advantage, careerism or hunger for power, and humbly making ourselves instruments of the salvation carried out by Jesus\u2019 sacrifice. A Christian\u2019s mission in the world is splendid, it is a mission intended for everyone, it is a mission of service, excluding no one; it requires a great deal of generosity and above all setting one\u2019s gaze and heart facing on High, to invoke the Lord\u2019s help. There is a great need for Christians who joyfully witness to the Gospel in everyday life. The disciples, sent out by Jesus, \u201creturned with joy\u201d (v. 17). When we do this, our heart fills with joy. (Angelus, 3 July 2016)",

And it is  John Chrysostom who makes a most profound reflection: \u201cif you do not go out as a lamb but go as a wolf among wolves, the Lord will not protect you; defend yourself on your own\u201d. When the preacher believes he is too intelligent or when one who has the responsibility of issuing forth the Word of God tries to be sly and thinks I am getting along with these people, then it will end badly, or he will negotiate God\u2019s Word with powerful and arrogant people.

At the same time, he leads us more and more to turn our interior gaze to Jesus, as the model of our way of acting and of relating with God the Father and with the brethren.  In intimacy with God and in listening to his Word, little by little we put aside our own way of thinking, which is most often dictated by our closures, by our prejudice and by our ambitions, and we learn instead to ask the Lord: what is your desire?

(\u2026) They are like three temptations: to sugar-coat the Gospel, to water it down; second: persecution; and third: the feeling that God has left us alone. Even Jesus suffered this trial in the Garden of Olives and on the Cross: \u201cFather, why have you forsaken me?\u201d, Jesus asks. At times one feels this spiritual barrenness; we must not fear it.

            "The first gift of the Holy Spirit according to this list is therefore wisdom. But it is not simply human wisdom, which is the fruit of knowledge and experience. In the Bible we are told that Solomon, at the time of his coronation as King of Israel, had asked for the gift of wisdom (cf. 1 Kings 3:9). And wisdom is precisely this: it is the grace of being able to see everything with the eyes of God. It is simply this: it is to see the world, to see situations, circumstances, problems, everything through God\u2019s eyes. This is wisdom. Sometimes we see things according to our liking or according to the condition of our heart, with love or with hate, with envy.... No, this is not God\u2019s perspective. Wisdom is what the Holy Spirit works in us so as to enable us to see things with the eyes of God. This is the gift of wisdom. (General Audience, 9 April 2014)",
            "He who loves father or mother\u2026 son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me\u201d (v. 37). Jesus certainly does not intend to undervalue love for parents and children, but he knows that if family bonds are put in first place, they can deviate from the true good. We see this: some forms of corruption in governments come about precisely because love for family is greater than love for country, and so they put family members in charge. (\u2026) When, instead, love for parents and children is inspired and purified by love for the Lord, it then becomes wholly fruitful and produces good fruits within the family itself and well beyond it. Jesus says this phrase in this sense. Let us also remember how Jesus rebukes the doctors of the law who cause their parents to lack what is necessary to them on the pretext of offering it at the altar, of giving it to the Church (cf. Mk 7:8-13). He rebukes them! True love for Jesus requires a true love for parents and children, but if we seek out family interests first, this always leads to the wrong path.

            "Jesus himself, in sending his disciples on mission, says to them: \u201cHe who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me\u201d (Mt 10:40). It is important that the people be able to perceive that for that disciple Jesus is truly \u201cthe Lord\u201d; He is truly the centre of his or her life, the everything of life. It does not matter then if, as for every human being, he or she has limitations and even makes mistakes \u2014 as long as he or she has the humility to recognize them; the important thing is that they not have a duplicitous heart \u2014 and this is dangerous. (\u2026) Here our experience as priests teaches us something very beautiful, something very important: it is precisely this welcoming of the holy, faithful People of God; it is precisely that \u201ccup of cold water\u201d (v. 42) that the Lord speaks of today in the Gospel, given with affectionate faith, which helps you to be a good priest! There is a reciprocity in mission too: if you leave everything for Jesus, the people recognize the Lord in you; but at the same time it helps you to convert each day to him, so as to renew and purify yourself from compromises and to overcome temptations. The closer a priest is to the People of God, the closer will he feel to Jesus, and the closer a priest is to Jesus, the closer will he feel to the People of God. (Angelus, 2 July 2017)"

To us or to God? A text of the Eucharistic liturgy invites us to pray to God in this way, it says this: \u201cAlthough you have no need of our praise, yet our thanksgiving is itself your gift, since our praises add nothing to your greatness, but profit us for salvation\u201d (Roman Missal , Common Preface IV).

And his prayer also leads us, readers of the Gospel, to judge our personal defeats in a different way, to judge differently the situations in which we do not see clearly the presence and action of God, when it seems that evil prevails and there is no way to stop it. Jesus, who highly recommended the prayer of asking, at the very moment when he would have had reason to ask the Father for explanations, instead begins to praise him. It seems to be a contradiction, but therein lies the truth. (\u2026) That too is the time for praise, like Jesus who in the dark moment praises the Father.

Conscious of their humble and wretched condition, they know that they depend on the Lord\u2019s mercy, awaiting from Him the only help possible.

The Lord teaches us not to be afraid to follow Him, because the hope that we place in Him will never disappoint. Thus, we are called to learn from Him what it means to live on mercy so as to be instruments of mercy. Live on mercy so as to be instruments of mercy: live on mercy and feel needful of Jesus\u2019 mercy, and when we feel in need of forgiveness, of consolation, let us learn to be merciful to others. Keeping our gaze fixed on the Son of God allows us to understand how far we still have to go; but at the same time it instills us with the joy of knowing that we are walking with Him and we are never alone. Have courage, therefore, have courage! Let us not be robbed of the joy of being the Lord\u2019s disciples. (General Audience, 14 September 2016)"

It is a relationship of intimacy, a mystical relationship, a relationship without words. \"Ah Father, it's the mystics who do it!\" No, it is for all of us, it's down with small thoughts: \"Lord, I know that Your are in me: give me the strength and I will do what You tell me\". In that intimate dialogue, the Lord is present, the Lord is present in us, the Father is present in us, the Spirit is present in us; they remain in us. But I must remain in them\u2026 (Santa Marta, 13 May 2020)",
            "The Holy Spirit is an active memory; he constantly rekindles the love of God in our hearts. (\u2026) We always remember the things that go wrong; we listen to the voice within us that reminds us of our failures and failings, the voice that keeps saying: \u201cLook, yet another failure, yet another disappointment. You will never succeed; you cannot do it\u201d. This is a terrible thing to be told. Yet the Holy Spirit tells us something completely different. He reminds us: \u201cHave you fallen? You are a son or daughter of God. You are a unique, elect, precious and beloved child. Even when you lose confidence in yourself, God has confidence in you!\u201d This is the \u201cmemory\u201d of the Spirit, what the Spirit constantly reminds us: God knows you. You may forget about God, but he does not forget about you. He remembers you always. (Homily, Pentecost, 5 June 2022)",
            "The Bible says that Moses spoke to the Lord face to face, like a friend, and this is how prayer must be: free, insistent, with arguments, [even] \u2018reproving\u2019 the Lord a little: \u2018but you promised me this and you didn\u2019t do it!\u2019\u201d. Prayer, is like \u201cspeaking with a friend: in prayer one opens one\u2019s heart\u201d. Moses went down the mountain reinvigorated, saying \u2018I got to know the Lord better\u2019. And that strength allowed him to resume his work of leading the people to the Promised Land\u201d. For \u201cprayer reinvigorates\u201d. May the Lord give us all grace, for prayer is a grace. It changes our hearts, it makes us understand better who our God truly is. However, it is important not to speak to God with empty words like the pagans. Instead, we need to tell him the truth: \u201cbut look, Lord, I have this problem in my family, with my son, with this or that.... What is to be done? You can\u2019t leave me like this!\u201d. This is prayer. Does this prayer take a long time? Yes, it takes time. (Homily Santa Marta, 3 April 2014)"

            "The gestures of that man and the merchant who go searching, depriving themselves of their goods in order to buy more precious treasures, are decisive gestures; they are radical gestures; I would say that they are only \u2018one way\u2019 gestures, not a \u2018round trip\u2019: they are \u2018one way\u2019 gestures. Moreover, they are made with joy because both of them have found a treasure. We are called upon to assume the attitude of these two Gospel figures, so that we too may become healthily restless seekers of the Kingdom of Heaven. It is a matter of abandoning the heavy burden of our worldly certainties that prevent us from seeking and building up the Kingdom: the desire for possession, the thirst for profit and power, and thinking only about ourselves.\nIn our times, as we are all aware, the lives of some people can end up mediocre and dull because they probably do not go in search of a true treasure: they are content with attractive but fleeting things, glittering flashes that prove illusory as they give way to darkness. Instead the light of the Kingdom is not like fireworks, it is light: fireworks last only an instant, whereas the light of the Kingdom accompanies us all our life.\nThe Kingdom of Heaven is the opposite of the superfluous things that the world offers; it is the opposite of a dull life: it is a treasure that renews life every day and leads it to expand towards wider horizons. Indeed, those who have found this treasure have a creative and inquisitive heart, which does not repeat but rather invents, tracing and setting out on new paths which lead us to love God, to love others, and to truly love ourselves. (Angelus, 26 July 2020)",
            "These parallel stories highlight two characteristics regarding possession of the Kingdom of God: searching and sacrifice. It is true that the Kingdom of God is offered to all \u2014 it is a gift, it is a present, it is a grace \u2014 but it does not come on a silver platter: it requires dynamism; it is about searching, journeying, working hard. The attitude of searching is the essential condition for finding. The heart must burn with the desire to reach the valuable good, that is, the Kingdom of God which is made present in the person of Jesus. He is the hidden treasure; he is the pearl of great value. He is the fundamental discovery who can make a decisive change in our lives, filling it with meaning.\nFaced with the unexpected discovery, both the farmer and the merchant realize that they are facing a unique opportunity which should not be missed; hence, they sell all that they own. Assessing the inestimable value of the treasure leads to a decision that also implies sacrifice, detachment and renunciation. When the treasure and the pearl are discovered, that is, when we have found the Lord, we must not let this discovery become barren, but rather sacrifice everything else in order to acquire it. It is not a question of disdaining the rest but of subordinating them to Jesus, putting him in first place; grace in first place. (Angelus, 30 July 2017)"

The Bible uses a beautiful image to explain our creation: God who with his hands forms us out of mud, out of the clay of the earth, into his image and likeness.

In a few words, we can say that they did not accept the scandal of the Incarnation. (\u2026) and they thought it was scandalous that the immensity of God should be revealed in the smallness of our flesh, that the Son of God should be the son of a carpenter, that the divine should be hidden in the human, that God should inhabit a face, the words, the gestures of a simple man.

The disciples reason with worldly logic, by which each person must think of himself; they reason as if to say: \u201cSort it out for yourselves\u201d. Jesus reasons with God\u2019s logic, which is that of sharing. (Angelus, 3 August 2014)",
            "For them, God is the one who has made the law. But this is not the God of revelation. The God of revelation is a God who has begun to walk with us from Abraham to Jesus Christ, God walking with His people. And when you lose this close relationship with the Lord, you fall into this dull mindset that believes in the self-sufficiency of salvation with the fulfillment of the law. This leads us to understand the revelation of God, to understand God's heart, to understand God's salvation - the key to knowledge - we can say it is very neglected. One forgets the freedom of salvation; forgetting the closeness of God and forgetting God's mercy. (Santa Marta, 19 October 2017)",
            "Today\u2019s Gospel reminds us that faith in the Lord and in his Word does not open a way for us where everything is easy and calm; it does not rescue us from life\u2019s storms. Faith gives us the assurance of a Presence, the presence of Jesus who encourages us to overcome the existential tempests, the certainty of a hand that grabs hold of us so as to help us face the difficulties, pointing the way for us even when it is dark. Faith, in short, is not an escape route from life\u2019s problems, but it sustains the journey and gives it meaning. This is the guarantee. (Angelus, 13 August 2017)",
            "This episode offers a wonderful image of the reality of the Church throughout the ages: a boat that, as she makes the crossing, must also weather contrary winds and storms which threaten to capsize her. What saves her are not the courage and qualities of her men: the guarantee against shipwreck is faith in Christ and in his Word. This is the guarantee: faith in Jesus and in his Word. (Angelus, 13 August 2017)",
            "This Gospel narrative is an invitation to abandon ourselves trustingly to God in every moment of our life, especially in the moment of trial and turmoil. When we have strong feelings of doubt and fear and we seem to be sinking, in life\u2019s difficult moments where everything becomes dark, we must not be ashamed to cry out like Peter: \u201cLord, save me\u201d (v. 30). To knock on God\u2019s heart, on Jesus\u2019s heart. \u201cLord, save me.\u201d It is a beautiful prayer! We can repeat it many times. \u201cLord, save me.\u201d And Jesus\u2019s gesture, who immediately reaches out His hand and grasps that of His friend, should be contemplated at length: this is Jesus. Jesus does this. Jesus is the Father\u2019s hand who never abandons us, the strong and faithful hand of the Father, who always and only wants what is good for us. (Angelus, 9 August 2020)"

Thus, here is the meaning of being wise and prudent: it is a matter of not waiting until the last minute of our lives to cooperate with the grace of God, but rather to do so as of now. It would be good to consider for a moment: one day will be the last. If it were today, how prepared am I? The lamp is a symbol of the faith that illuminates our life, while the oil is a symbol of the charity that nourishes the light of faith, making it fruitful and credible. The condition for being prepared for the encounter with the Lord is not only faith, but a Christian life abundant with love and charity for our neighbour. If we allow ourselves to be guided by what seems more comfortable, by seeking our own interests, then our life becomes barren, incapable of giving life to others, and we accumulate no reserve of oil for the lamp of our faith; and this \u2014 faith \u2014 will be extinguished at the moment of the Lord\u2019s coming, or even before. If instead we are watchful and seek to do good, with acts of love, of sharing, of service to a neighbour in difficulty, then we can be at peace while we wait for the bridegroom to come.

Each of us is a small stone, but in Jesus\u2019 hands participates in the building of the Church. And all of us, as small as we are, are rendered \u201cliving stones\u201d because when Jesus takes his stone in hand, he makes it his own; he infuses it with life, full of life, full of life from the Holy Spirit, full of life from his love. And thus we have a place and a mission in the Church: she is a community of life, made up of very many stones, all different, which form a single edifice as a sign of fraternity and communion. Moreover, today\u2019s Gospel reminds us that Jesus also wanted Peter as a visible centre of communion for his Church \u2014 he too, is not a great stone; he is a small stone, but taken up by Jesus, he becomes the centre of communion \u2014 in Peter and in those who would succeed him in the same responsibility of primacy, who since the beginning have been identified as the Bishops of Rome, the city where Peter and Paul bore witness in blood.

Christ, brothers and sisters, is not a memory of the past, but the God of the present. If He were merely an historical figure, to imitate Him today would be impossible: we would find ourselves faced with the great chasm of time, and above all, faced with his example, which is like a very high, unscalable mountain; we want to climb it, but lack the ability and the necessary means. Instead, Jesus is alive: let us remember this.

            "A mustard seed is tiny, yet Jesus says that faith this size, small but true and sincere, suffices to achieve what is humanly impossible, unthinkable. And it is true! We all know people who are simple, humble, but whose faith is so strong it can move mountains! Let us think, for example, of some mothers and fathers who face very difficult situations; or of some sick, and even gravely ill, people who transmit serenity to those who come to visit them. How many people among us have such strong, humble faith, and what good they do! And how do we draw from this strength? We draw it from God in prayer. Prayer is the breath of faith: in a relationship of trust, in a relationship of love, dialogue cannot be left out, and prayer is the dialogue of the soul with God. (Angelus, Oct 6, 2013)",

No: a courageous prayer, like that of Abraham, who struggled with the Lord to save the city, like that of many people, so many people who have faith and pray with faith. Prayer works wonders, but we have to believe! I think we can make a beautiful prayer ... and tell Him today, all day long, 'Lord, I believe, help my unbelief' ... and when people ask ask us to pray for the many people who suffer in wars, all refugees, all of these dramas that exist right now, pray, but with your heart to the Lord: 'Do it!', but tell Him: 'Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief 'that is also in my prayers. Let us do this today. (Santa Marta, 20 May 2013)",

Mercy, both in Jesus and in ourselves, is a journey which starts in the heart in order to reach the hands. What does this mean? Jesus looks at you, he heals you with his mercy, he says to you: \u201cArise!\u201d, and your heart is new\u2026 and with a new heart, with the heart healed by Jesus I can perform works of mercy through the hands, seeking to help, to heal the many who are in need. Mercy is a journey that starts in the heart and ends in the hands, namely in the works of mercy. (General Audience, 10 August 2016)",

He cannot wait to pour out his grace and joy into our hearts; but unfortunately, it is we who keep our distance, through timidness, laziness or unbelief. Many of us, when we pray, do not believe that the Lord can work miracles. I am reminded of the story \u2014 which I have seen \u2014 of the father who was told by the doctors that his nine-year-old daughter would not survive the night; she was in hospital. And he took a bus and travelled 70 kilometres to the Shrine of Our Lady. It was closed and, clinging to the gate, he spent the whole night praying: \u201cLord, save her! Lord, give her life\u201d! He prayed to Our Lady all night long, crying out to God, crying out from his heart. Then in the morning, when he returned to the hospital, he found his wife weeping. And he thought: \u201cShe is dead\u201d. And his wife said: \u201cNo one understands, no one understands, the doctors say it\u2019s a strange thing, she seems to have healed\u201d.

            "Jesus underlines that he has not come into this world to give something, but to give himself, his life, as nourishment for those who have faith in Him. Every time that we participate in Holy Mass and we are nourished by the Body of Christ, the presence of Jesus and of the Holy Spirit acts in us, shaping our hearts, communicating an interior disposition to us that translates into conduct according to the Gospel. The charity of Christ, welcomed with an open heart, changes us, transforms us, renders us capable of loving not according to human measure, always limited, but according to the measure of God. And what is the measure of God? Without measure! And so we become capable of loving even those who do not love us: and this is not easy. Opposing evil with good, with pardon, with sharing, with welcome. Thanks to Jesus and to his Spirit, even our life becomes \u201cbread broken\u201d for our brothers. And living like this we discover true joy! The joy of making of oneself a gift, of reciprocating the great gift that we have first received, without merit of our own. This is beautiful: our life is made a gift! (Angelus, 22 June 2014)",
            "Before Jesus\u2019 invitation to nourish ourselves of his Body and of his Blood, we might feel the need to dispute and to resist, as did those listeners whom today\u2019s Gospel spoke of. This happens when we struggle to model our existence after that of Jesus, to act according to his criteria. By nourishing ourselves of this food we can enter into full harmony with Christ, with his sentiments, with his behaviour. This is so important: to go to Mass and partake in Communion, because receiving Communion is receiving this living Christ, who transforms us within and prepares us for heaven. (Angelus, 19 August 2018)",
            "This word of the Lord astonishes us, and makes us think. It introduces the dynamic of faith, which is a relationship: the relationship between the human person \u2014 all of us \u2014 and the Person of Jesus, where the Father plays a decisive role, and, of course, the Holy Spirit does too, which is implied here. To believe in Him, it is not enough to meet Jesus, it is not enough to read the Bible, the Gospel \u2014 this is important! But it is not enough. It is not even enough to witness a miracle, such as that of the multiplication of the loaves. (\u2026) God the Father draws us to Jesus: it is we who open or close our hearts. Instead, faith, which is like a seed deep in the heart, blossoms when we let the Father draw us to Jesus, and we \u201cgo to Him\u201d with an open heart, without prejudices; then we recognize in his face the Face of God, and in his words the Word of God, because the Holy Spirit has made us enter into the relationship of love and of life between Jesus and God the Father. And there we receive a gift, the gift of the faith.\nWith this attitude of faith, we can also understand the meaning of the \u201cBread of Life\u201d that Jesus gives us, and which he describes in this way: \u201cI am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh\u201d (Jn 6:51). In Jesus, in his \u201cflesh\u201d \u2014 that is, in his concrete humanity \u2014 is all the love of God, which is the Holy Spirit. Those who let themselves be drawn by this love go to Jesus and go with faith, and receive from Him life, eternal life. (Angelus, 9 August 2015)"

The great gift of life is the first gift that we received. Sometimes in life we risk forgetting about this, as if we were the masters of our existence, and instead we are fundamentally dependent. In reality, it is a motive of great joy to feel at every stage of life, in every situation, in every social condition, that we are and we remain sons and daughters. This is the main message that children give us, by their very presence: simply by their presence they remind us that each and every one of us is a son or daughter.But there are so many gifts, so many riches that children bring to humanity. I shall mention only a few.\nThey bring their way of seeing reality, with a trusting and pure gaze. A child has spontaneous trust in his father and mother; he has spontaneous trust in God, in Jesus, in Our Lady. At the same time, his interior gaze is pure, not yet tainted by malice, by duplicity, by the \u201cincrustations\u201d of life which harden the heart. We know that children are also marked by original sin, that they are selfish, but they preserve purity, and interior simplicity. But children are not diplomats: they say what they feel, say what they see, directly.

            "This teaching of Jesus is very clear and defends the dignity of marriage as a union of love which implies fidelity. What allows the spouses to remain united in marriage is a love of mutual giving supported by Christ\u2019s grace. However, if in the spouses, individual interests, one\u2019s own satisfaction prevails, then their union cannot endure. And the Gospel passage itself reminds us, with great realism, that man and woman, called to experience a relationship of love, may regretfully behave in a way that places it in crisis. (\u2026) God\u2019s way of acting with his unfaithful people \u2014 that is, with us \u2014 teaches us that wounded love can be healed by God through mercy and forgiveness. (Angelus, 7 October 2018)"

Brothers and sisters, it is not about material sustenance, but a living and life-giving bread, which conveys the very life of God. When we receive Communion we receive the very life of God. To have this life it is necessary to nourish ourselves of the Gospel and of the love of our brothers and sisters. May the Virgin Mary support our aim to enter into communion with Jesus Christ, by nourishing ourselves of his Eucharist, so as to become in our turn bread broken for our brothers and sisters.

In order to answer, one must be aware what is happening in Jesus\u2019 heart as he breaks the bread for the hungry crowd. Knowing that he will have to die on the cross for us, Jesus identifies himself with that bread broken and shared, and it becomes for him the \u201csign\u201d of the Sacrifice that awaits him. This process culminates in the Last Supper, where the bread and wine truly become his Body and his Blood. It is the Eucharist, which Jesus leaves us with a specific purpose: that we may become one with Him. Indeed he says: \u201cHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him\u201d (v. 56). That \u201cabiding\u201d: Jesus in us and we in Jesus.

            "\u201cUnless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you\u201d (v. 53). Here the blood is present together with the flesh. In biblical language, flesh and blood express concrete humanity. The people and the disciples themselves sense that Jesus invites them to enter into communion with him, to \u2018eat\u2019 him, his humanity, in order to share with him the gift of life for the world. So much for triumphs and mirages of success! It is precisely the sacrifice of Jesus who gives himself for us. This bread of life, the sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, comes to us freely given at the table of the Eucharist. Around the altar we find what spiritually feeds us and quenches our thirst today and for eternity. Each time we participate in the Holy Mass, in a certain sense, we anticipate heaven on earth, because from the Eucharistic sustenance, the Body and Blood of Jesus, we learn what eternal life is. It is living for the Lord: \u201che who eats me will live because of me\u201d (v. 57), the Lord says. The Eucharist shapes us so that we live not only for ourselves but for the Lord and for our brothers and sisters. Life\u2019s happiness and eternity depend on our ability to render fruitful the evangelical love we receive in the Eucharist. (\u2026) By nourishing ourselves of this food we can enter into full harmony with Christ, with his sentiments, with his behaviour. This is so important: to go to Mass and partake in Communion, because receiving Communion is receiving this living Christ, who transforms us within and prepares us for heaven.

            "This means choosing gratuitousness rather than self-seeking and calculating to obtain a reward, seeking interest and trying to increase your wealth. Indeed, the poor, the simple, those who \u2018don\u2019t count\u2019, can never reciprocate an invitation to a meal. In this way Jesus shows his preference for the poor and the excluded, who are the privileged in the Kingdom of God, and he launches the fundamental message of the Gospel which is to serve others out of love for God. (Angelus, 28 August 2016)",
            "There is one last idea that the Gospel emphasizes: the mandatory garment of the invited guests.  It is not enough to respond just once to the invitation, simply to say \u201cyes\u201d and then do nothing else.  Day by day, we have to put on the wedding garment, the \u201chabit\u201d of practising love.  We cannot say, \u201cLord, Lord\u201d, without experiencing and putting into practice God\u2019s will (cf. Mt 7:21).  We need to put on God\u2019s love and to renew our choice for him daily. (Homily, Canonization Mass, 15 October 2017)",
            "God\u2019s goodness has no bounds and discriminates against no one. For this reason the banquet of the Lord\u2019s gifts is universal, for everyone. Everyone is given the opportunity to respond to His invitation, to His call; no one has the right to feel privileged or to claim an exclusive right. All of this induces us to break the habit of conveniently placing ourselves at the centre, as did the High Priests and the Pharisees. This must not be done; we must open ourselves to the peripheries, also acknowledging that, at the margins too, even one who is cast aside and scorned by society is the object of God\u2019s generosity. (Angelus, 12 October 2014)  ",
            "The king who \u201cgave a marriage feast for his son\u201d, is the image of the Father who prepared for the entire human family a wonderful celebration of love and communion around his only begotten Son. (\u2026) However, the Lord places one condition: to wear a wedding garment. (\u2026) The people went as they were dressed, as they were able to dress; they were not wearing gala attire. But they were given a type of capelet, a gift, at the entrance. (\u2026) The wedding garment \u2014 this capelet \u2014 symbolizes the mercy that God freely gives us, namely, grace. Without grace we cannot take a step forward in Christian life. Everything is grace. It is not enough to accept the invitation to follow the Lord; one must be open to a journey of conversion, which changes the heart. (Angelus, 11 October 2020)",
            "This is how God reacts: when he is rejected, rather than giving up, he starts over and asks that all those found at the thoroughfares be called, excluding no one. No one is excluded from the house of God. (\u2026) However, the Lord places one condition: to wear a wedding garment. Let us return to the parable. When the hall is full, the king arrives and greets the latest guests, but he sees one of them without a wedding garment, that kind of little cape that each guest received as a gift at the entrance. The people went as they were dressed, as they were able to dress; they were not wearing gala attire. But they were given a type of capelet, a gift, at the entrance. That man, having rejected the free gift, excluded himself: thus, the king could do nothing but throw him out. This man accepted the invitation but then decided that it meant nothing to him: he was a self-sufficient person; he had no desire to change or to allow the Lord to change him. The wedding garment \u2014 this capelet \u2014 symbolizes the mercy that God freely gives us, namely, grace. Without grace we cannot take a step forward in Christian life. Everything is grace. It is not enough to accept the invitation to follow the Lord; one must be open to a journey of conversion, which changes the heart. (Angelus, 11 October 2020)",
            "Jesus went to lunch with the publicans, who were public sinners; they were the bad ones. God is not afraid of our spirits wounded by many cruelties, because he loves us; he invites us. And the Church is called to reach the daily thoroughfares, that is, the geographic and existential peripheries of humanity, those places on the margins, those situations where the hopeless remnants of humanity camp out and live. It is a matter of not settling for comforts and the customary ways of evangelization and witnessing to charity, but rather of opening the doors of our hearts and our communities to everyone, because the Gospel is not reserved to a select few. (\u2026) However, the Lord places one condition: to wear a wedding garment. Let us return to the parable. (\u2026) The wedding garment \u2014 this capelet \u2014 symbolizes the mercy that God freely gives us, namely, grace. Without grace we cannot take a step forward in Christian life. Everything is grace. (Angelus, 11 October 2020)",
            "It is God who seeks mankind. But in the first case God goes to Adam, after the sin, and asks him: \u201cWhere are you?\u201d, and Adam responds: \u201cI hid myself\u201d. In the second case, however, God goes to Mary, without sin, who responds: \u201cBehold, I am the handmaid of the Lord\u201d. Here I am is the opposite of I hid myself. (\u2026)  Here I am is the key phrase for life. It marks the passage from a horizontal life, centred on oneself and one\u2019s own needs, to a vertical life, ascending toward God. Here I am is being available to the Lord; it is the cure for selfishness, the antidote to a dissatisfied life, which is always lacking something. Here I am is the remedy against the aging of sin; it is the therapy for staying young within. Here I am is believing that God counts more than my \u2018me\u2019. It is choosing to bet on the Lord, docile to his surprises. This is why saying here I am to him is the highest praise we can offer him. Why not begin our days with a \u2018here I am, Lord\u2019? It would be beautiful to say each morning: \u201cHere I am, Lord, today let your will be done in me\u201d. We will say it in praying the Angelus, but we can repeat it now, together. Here I am, Lord, today let your will be done in me! (Angelus, 8 December 2018)"

They are many: today\u2019s martyrs outnumber the martyrs of the first centuries. Let us express our closeness to these brothers and sisters. We are a single body and these Christians are the bleeding limbs of the body of Christ who is the Church. (General audience, 29 April 2020)",
            "After this purification, after this continuous descent into annihilation, leading to the annihilation of Jesus, his life ends. That confused king \u201cis able to make a decision, but not because his heart is converted\u201d; but rather \u201cbecause wine gives him courage\u201d. And thus John\u2019s life is ended \u201cunder the authority of a mediocre, drunken and corrupt king, because of a dancer\u2019s whim and because of the vindictive hatred of an adulterous woman\u201d. Thus \u201cthe great one meets his end, the greatest man born of woman\u201d. (\u2026) I think about our martyrs, today\u2019s martyrs, those men, women, children who are persecuted, hated, driven from of their homes, tortured, massacred\u201d. And this, he underlined, \u201cis not a thing of the past: this is happening today. Our martyrs meet their end under the authority of corrupt people who hate Jesus Christ\u201d. For this reason, \u201cit will do us good to think about our martyrs. (\u2026) I too will meet my end. We all will. No one can \u2018buy\u2019 life. We too, willingly or unwillingly, are travelling the road of life\u2019s existential annihilation.

            "\u201cLife, has value only in giving it, in giving it in love, in truth, in giving it to others, in daily life, in the family.\u201d If someone preserves life for himself, guards it like the king in his corruption or the woman with her hatred, or the daughter with her vanity, a little like an adolescent, unknowingly, life dies and withers, becoming useless. I urge you all to think about the 4 characters in the Gospel: King Herod who is \u201ccorrupt and undecided\u201d, Herodias, his brother\u2019s wife, who \u201conly knew how to hate\u201d, Salome, \"the vain dancer\", and the beheaded prophet, and let each one of us open our hearts so that the Lord may speak to us about this.

(\u2026) The Lord comes, but you prefer to follow the longing you feel; your brother knocks at your door, but he is a nuisance to you because he upsets your plans \u2014 and this is the attitude of consumerism. (\u2026) Time is wasted on pastimes, but people have no time for God and for others. And when we live for things, things are never enough, greed increases and others get in the way and people end up feeling threatened and, as they are ever dissatisfied and angry, the level of hatred rises.

Watching was the task of the sentinel, who stayed awake to keep watch while everyone else was asleep. Keeping watch means not giving in to the sleep that enfolds everyone. In order to watch it is necessary to have a sure hope: that the night will not last for ever, that dawn will soon break.

In this way he emphasizes the primacy of interiority, that is, the primacy of the \u201cheart\u201d: it is not the external things that make us holy or unholy, but the heart which expresses our intentions, our choices and the will to do all for the love of God. (Angelus, 30 August 2015)",
            "We can perform a practice as old as the Church, but good: the examination of conscience. Who of us, at night, at the end of the day, remains by himself, by herself, and asks the question: what happened today in my heart? What happened? What things have passed through my heart? If we don\u2019t do this, we have truly failed to know how to watch and guard our hearts well. (Santa Marta, 10 October 2014)",
            "Jesus (\u2026) emphasizes the primacy of interiority, that is, the primacy of the \u201cheart\u201d: it is not the external things that make us holy or unholy, but the heart which expresses our intentions, our choices and the will to do all for the love of God. External behaviour is the result of what we decide in the heart, and not the contrary: with a change in external behaviour, but not a change of heart, we are not true Christians. The boundary between good and evil does not pass outside of us, but rather within us. We could ask ourselves: where is my heart? Jesus said: \u201cWhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also\u201d. What is my treasure? Is it Jesus, is it his teaching? If so, then the heart is good. Or is my treasure something else? Thus it is a heart which needs purification and conversion. (Angelus, 30 August 2015)"

            "Paul said that he did not present himself in order to convince his interlocutors with arguments, with words, even with images. The Apostle chose instead another mode, another style, and that is a demonstration of the Spirit and power, that \u2014 these are Paul\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cyour faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God\u201d. In effect, the Apostle recalled that the Word of God is something different, something which is unequaled by a human word, a wise word, a scientific word, a philosophical word\u201d. The Word of God, indeed, is something else, it comes in another way: it is different because it is how God speaks. Because Jesus is precisely in His Word, in His Gospel. Every time I read the Gospel, I find Jesus. But how do I receive the Word of God?. It must be received, as one receives Jesus, that is, with an open heart, with a humble heart, with the spirit of the Beatitudes. Because this is how Jesus came, in humility: he came in poverty, he came anointed by the Holy Spirit\u201d. It will do us good during the day today to ask ourselves: But how do I receive the Word of God? The response is clear: As one receives Jesus Christ. The Church tells us that Jesus is present in the Scripture, in His Word. This is why, I have advised you many times to always carry a small Gospel with you \u2014to keep it in your purse, in your pocket, and read a passage from the Gospel during the day to find Jesus there. (Santa Marta, 1 Sept 2014)\n ",
            "It is beautiful how Jesus presents himself, which is Jesus\u2019 identity card in the Synagogue of Nazareth! Let us hear how he does it: \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor\u201d (Lk 4:18). Jesus presents himself in the Synagogue of his village as the Anointed One, the One who was anointed by the Holy Spirit. esus is filled with the Holy Spirit and is the source of the Spirit promised by the Father (cf. Jn 15:26; Lk 24:49; Acts 1:8, 2:33). In reality, on the evening of Easter, the Risen One breathes on his disciples, saying to them: \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit\u201d (Jn 20:22); and on the Day of Pentecost the power of the Spirit descends upon the Apostles in an extraordinary form (cf. Acts 2:1-4), as we know. If the Spirit works in every sacrament, it is in a special way that in Confirmation \u201cthe faithful receive the Holy Spirit as a Gift\u201d (Paul vi, Apostolic Constitution Divinae Consortium Naturae). And at the moment of anointing, the Bishop says these words: \u201cBe sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit\u201d: the Holy Spirit is God\u2019s great gift. And we all have the Spirit within. The Spirit is in our heart, in our soul. And the Spirit guides us in life so that we may become the true salt and the true light for mankind. (General Audience, 23 may 2018)",
            "According to the people of Nazareth, God is too great to humble himself to speak through such a simple man! It is the scandal of the Incarnation: the unsettling event of a God made flesh who thinks with the mind of a man, works and acts with the hands of a man, loves with a human heart, a God who struggles, eats and sleeps like one of us. The Son of God overturns every human framework: it is not the disciples who washed the feet of the Lord, but it is the Lord who washed the feet of the disciples. This is a reason for scandal and incredulity, not only in that period, but in all ages, even today. (Angelus, 8 July 2018)",
            "Evangelizing the poor: this is Jesus\u2019 mission. According to what he says, this is also the mission of the Church, and of every person baptized in the Church. Being a Christian is the same thing as being a missionary. Proclaiming the Gospel with one\u2019s word, and even before, with one\u2019s life, is the primary aim of the Christian community and of each of its members. Pay heed: it does not only involve offering social assistance, much less political activity. It involves offering the strength of the Gospel of God, who converts hearts, heals wounds, transforms human and social relationships according to the logic of love. The poor are indeed at the centre of the Gospel. (Angelus, 24 January 2016)",
            "Jesus begins by saying: \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled\u201d. Let us dwell on this today. The Word of God is always \u201ctoday\u201d. Isaiah\u2019s prophecy dates back to earlier centuries, but Jesus, \u201cin the power of the Spirit\u201d (v. 14), makes it relevant and, above all, brings it to fulfilment, and shows how to receive the Word of God: today. It is not like ancient history, no: today. It speaks to your heart today. Jesus\u2019 fellow countrymen are struck by his word. Even though, clouded by prejudice, they do not believe him, they realize that his teaching is different from that of the other teachers: they sense that there is more to Jesus. What is there? There is the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes it happens that our sermons and our teachings remain generic, abstract; they do not touch the soul and the life of the people. And why? Because they lack the power of this today; what Jesus \u201cfills with meaning\u201d in the power of the Spirit, is today. He is speaking to you today. Preaching runs this risk: without the anointing of the Spirit, it impoverishes the Word of God, and deteriorates to moralism or abstract concepts; it presents the Gospel with detachment, as if it were outside time, far from reality. And this is not the way. But a word in which the power of today does not pulsate, is not worthy of Jesus and does not help people\u2019s lives. This is why those who preach, please, should be the first to experience the today of Jesus, in order to be able to communicate it in the today of others. (Angelus, 23 January 2022)",

A Christian life without temptations is not Christian: it is ideological, it is gnostic, but it is not Christian. When the Father draws people to Jesus, there is another who pulls in an opposite way and makes war in you! Let's think about what our heart is like: do I feel this struggle in my heart? Between comfort or service to others, between having a little fun or praying and worshiping the Father, between one thing and another. Do I feel the struggle? The desire to do good versus something that stops me? Let each of us search our hearts for how the situation is going there.

Instead in Jesus\u2019 words have authority; Jesus is authoritative. And this touches the heart. Jesus\u2019 teaching has the same authority as God who speaks.

There are people who go through life talking about others, accusing others and never thinking of their own sins. And when I go to make my confession, how do I confess? Like a parrot? \u2018Bla, bla, bla\u2026 I did this, this\u2026\u2019 But are you touched at heart by what you have done? Many times, no. You go there to put on make-up, to make-yourself up a little bit in order to look beautiful.

It\u2019s a good question to get to the heart [of things]. Today let us ask the Lord for the grace, the grace to find ourselves face to face with Him with this wonder that His presence gives; and the grace to feel that we are sinners, but concretely, and to say with Peter: 'Depart from me, for I am a sinner.

            "The crowd is gathering around Jesus, while some disappointed fishermen, among them, Simon Peter, are washing their nets after a night of fishing that had gone badly. And so it is that Jesus climbs into Simon\u2019s boat; then he invites him to go out to sea and cast his nets again (cf. Lk 5:1-4). (\u2026) It was not a good time of the day for fishing, in broad daylight, but Peter trusts in Jesus. He does not base his trust on the strategies of fishermen, which he knows well, but rather he bases it on the newness of Jesus. That wonder that moved him to do what Jesus told him. It is the same for us too: if we welcome the Lord into our boat, we can put out to sea. With Jesus, we sail the sea of life without fear, without giving in to disappointment when one catches nothing, and without giving up and saying \u201cthere is nothing more that can be done\u201d. Always, in personal life as well as in the life of the Church and society, there is something beautiful and courageous that can be done, always. We can always start over \u2014 the Lord always invites us to get back on our feet because he opens up new possibilities. So let us accept the invitation: let us chase away pessimism and mistrust, and put out to sea with Jesus! Our little empty boat, too, will witness a miraculous catch. (Angelus, 6 February 2022)",
            "\u201cWe toiled all night and took nothing\u201d (v. 5), says Simon. How often, we too are left with a sense of defeat while disappointment and bitterness arise in our hearts. Two very dangerous seeds. So what does the Lord do? He chooses to climb into our boat. He wants to proclaim the Gospel from there. It is precisely that empty boat, the symbol of our incapacity, that becomes Jesus\u2019 \u201ccathedra\u201d, the pulpit from which he proclaims the Word.

When Jesus reproaches these people, these doctors of the law, he admonishes them for not having safeguarded the people with the law but for having made them slaves of so many little laws, of so many little things that they had to do. To new wine, new wineskins. This is why the Church asks us, all of us, for a few changes. She asks us to leave aside fleeting structures; they aren\u2019t necessary! And get new wineskins, those of the Gospel. They are different things. In fact, the Gospel\u2019s approach is a different approach, which leads to the fulfillment of the law.

The Lord has offered you the new wine but you have not changed the bottles, you have not changed. Worldliness is what ruins so many people, so many people! Good people, but this spirit of vanity, pride, of being seen, enters in... The Christian style is that of the Beatitudes: meekness, humility, patience in suffering, love for justice, ability to endure persecution, not judging others... If you want to know what the Christian style is like, so as not to fall into this accusatory style, the worldly style and the selfish style, read the Beatitudes.

Jesus is the bridegroom, the bridegroom who weds the Church, the groom who loves the Church, who gives his life for the Church. Jesus is the one who makes this wedding feast! Jesus asks us the joy of festivity, the joy of being Christians. He also asks of us the all: it\u2019s all Him. If we have something that is not of Him, repent, ask for forgiveness and move on.

            "In the Gospels, many pages tell of Jesus\u2019 encounters with the sick and of his commitment to healing them. He presents himself publicly as one who fights against illness and who has come to heal mankind of every evil: evils of the spirit and evils of the body. (\u2026) Jesus never held back from their care. He never passed by, never turned his face away. When a father or mother, or even just friends brought a sick person for him to touch and heal, he never let time be an issue; healing came before the law, even one as sacred as resting on the Sabbath (cf. Mk 3:1-6). The doctors of the law reproached Jesus because he healed on the Sabbath, he did good on the Sabbath. But the love of Jesus was in giving health, doing good: this always takes priority! (\u2026) The Church invites constant prayer for her own loved ones stricken with suffering. There must never be a lack of prayer for the sick. But rather, we must pray more, both personally and as a community. (General audience, 10 June 2015)"

            "\u201cIn the Gospel of Luke\u201d we have seen the Church in activity, in action: Jesus who prays, who chooses the Apostles, who gives a name to each one, who heals body and soul and who was among the disciples, and even among the crowds which sought to touch him, because from him came the strength that healed everyone\u201d. Precisely \u201cthis is the Church that which Paul taught us is this in action\u201d. The Apostle confirms that \u201cthe cornerstone is Jesus himself\u201d; and indeed, \u201cwithout Jesus there is no Church: he is the foundation of the Church\u201d. Jesus went out into the hills to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God. And \u201cthen comes all the rest: the people, the selection of the disciples, the healings, the casting out of demons\u201d. Therefore, \u201cthe cornerstone is Jesus, yes: but, it is a Jesus who prays\u201d. And \u201cJesus prays: he prayed and continues to pray for the Church\u201d. Thus, \u201cthe cornerstone of the Church is the Lord standing before the Father who intercedes for us, who prays for us: we pray to him, but the foundation is him who prays for us\u201d. (Santa Marta, 28 October 2016)",
            "The Gospels show us how prayer was fundamental in the relationship between Jesus and his disciples. This can already be seen in the choice of those who would later become the Apostles. Luke places their election in a precise context of prayer, and he says: \u201cIn these days he went out to the mountain to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles\u201d (6:12-13). Jesus chooses them after a night of prayer. It seems that there is no criterion in this choice other than prayer, the dialogue of Jesus with the Father. Judging from how those men were to behave, it would seem that the choice was not the best, as they all fled, they left him alone before the Passion; but it is precisely this, especially the presence of Judas, the future betrayer, that demonstrates that those names were inscribed in God\u2019s plan.

(\u2026) Let us not forget that what sustains each of us in life is Jesus\u2019 prayer for every one of us, with our first and last name, before the Father, showing him the wounds that are the price of our salvation. Even if our prayers were only stuttering, if they were compromised by a wavering faith, we must never cease to trust in him: I do not know how to pray but he prays for me. Supported by Jesus\u2019 prayer, our timid prayers rest on eagle wings and soar up to Heaven. Do not forget: Jesus is praying for me. (General audience, 2 June 2021)"

The suffering of mothers: we have all known strong women who have faced their children\u2019s suffering! (General audience, 10 May 2017)",
            "And in this time, of perceived orphanhood, this word has great importance. Jesus tells us: I will not leave you orphaned, I give you a mother. This legacy is also our pride: we have a mother, who is with us, who protects us, accompanies us, helps us, even in difficult times, in bad moments. The Church is a mother. She is our \u2018Holy Mother Church\u2019  which engenders us in baptism, enables us to grow in her community: Mother Mary and Mother Church know how to caress their children, they give tenderness. And where there is motherhood there is life, there is joy, there is peace; one grows in peace. (Santa Marta, 15 September 2015)",
            "Today it would be good to stop a moment and think about Our Lady\u2019s pain and sorrows. She is our Mother. And how she bore them, how she bore them well, with strength, with tears: they were not false tears, it was truly a heart destroyed with sorrow. It would be good to stop a moment and say to Our Lady: \u201cThank You for accepting to be Mother when the Angel said it to You, and thank You for accepting to be Mother when Jesus said it to You.\u201d (Santa Marta, 3 April 2020)",
            "May the tears you shed for us make this valley parched by our hatred, blossom anew.  Amid the thunder of weapons, may your prayer turn our thoughts to peace.  May your maternal touch soothe those who suffer and flee from the rain of bombs.  May your motherly embrace comfort those forced to leave their homes and their native land.  May your Sorrowful Heart move us to compassion and inspire us to open our doors and to care for our brothers and sisters who are injured and cast aside. Holy Mother of God, as you stood beneath the cross, Jesus, seeing the disciple at your side, said: \u201cBehold your son\u201d (Jn 19:26).  In this way he entrusted each of us to you.  To the disciple, and to each of us, he said: \u201cBehold, your Mother\u201d (v. 27).  Mother Mary, we now desire to welcome you into our lives and our history.  At this hour, a weary and distraught humanity stands with you beneath the cross, needing to entrust itself to you and, through you, to consecrate itself to Christ.  (\u2026)  Accept this act that we carry out with confidence and love.  Grant that war may end and peace spread throughout the world.  The \u201cFiat\u201d that arose from your heart opened the doors of history to the Prince of Peace.  We trust that, through your heart, peace will dawn once more.  To you we consecrate the future of the whole human family, the needs and expectations of every people, the anxieties and hopes of the world. Through your intercession, may God\u2019s mercy be poured out on the earth and the gentle rhythm of peace return to mark our days.  Our Lady of the \u201cFiat\u201d, on whom the Holy Spirit descended, restore among us the harmony that comes from God. (Act Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, 25 March 2022)",
            "The suffering of her dying Son, who had taken upon himself the sins and infirmities of humanity, pierced her own heart. Jesus suffered in the flesh, the man of sorrows, disfigured by evil (cf. Is 53:3ff). Mary suffered in spirit, as the compassionate Mother who dries our tears, comforts us and points to Christ\u2019s definitive victory. Mary, Mother of Sorrows, remains at the foot the cross. She simply stands there. She does not run away, or try to save herself, or find ways to alleviate her grief. Here is the proof of true compassion: to remain standing beneath the cross. To stand there weeping, yet with the faith that knows that, in her Son, God transfigures pain and suffering and triumphs over death. In contemplating the Sorrowful Mother, may we too open our hearts to a faith that becomes compassion, a faith that identifies with those who are hurting, suffering and forced to bear heavy crosses. A faith that does not remain abstract, but becomes incarnate in fellowship with those in need. A faith that imitates God\u2019s way of doing things, quietly relieves the suffering of our world and waters the soil of history with salvation.

Today, Jesus addresses this very direct and confidential question to each of us: (\u2026) Who am I for you?\u201d. Each person is called to respond, in his or her heart, allowing each one to be illuminated by the light that the Father gives us in order to know his Son Jesus. And it can also happen to us, as it did to Peter, that we passionately affirm: \u201cYou are the Christ\u201d. However, when Jesus tells us clearly what he told the disciples, that is, that his mission is fulfilled not on the wide road to success, but on the arduous path of the suffering, humiliated, rejected and crucified Servant, then it can also happen that we, like Peter, might protest and rebel because this contrasts with our expectations, with worldly expectations. In those moments, we too deserve Jesus\u2019 healthy rebuke: \u201cGet behind me, Satan! For you are not on the side of God, but of men\u201d. Brothers and sisters, the profession of faith in Jesus Christ cannot stop at words, but calls to be authenticated by practical choices and gestures, by a life characterized by God\u2019s love; it calls for a great life, a life with an abundance of love for neighbour. Jesus tells us that to follow him, to be his disciples, we must deny ourselves, that is, the demands of our own selfish pride, and take up our own cross. (Angelus, 16 September 2018)"

We are on a journey of faith, like the faith of this centurion, to encounter the Lord and to allow ourselves to be encountered by Him. (Santa Marta, 2 Dec 2013)",

            "Today\u2019s Gospel also speaks to us of service. It shows us two servants who have much to teach us: the servant of the centurion whom Jesus cures and the centurion himself, who serves the Emperor. The words used by the centurion to dissuade Jesus from coming to his house are remarkable, and often the very opposite of our own: \u201cLord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof\u201d (7:6); I did not presume to come to you\u201d (7:7); \u201cI also am a man set under authority\u201d (7:8). Jesus marvels at these words. He is struck by the centurion\u2019s great humility, by his meekness. (\u2026) Given his troubles, the centurion might have been anxious and could have demanded to be heard, making his authority felt. He could have insisted and even forced Jesus to come to his house. Instead, he was modest, unassuming and meek; he did not raise his voice or make a fuss. He acted, perhaps without even being aware of it, like God himself, who is \u201cmeek and humble of heart\u201d (Mt 11:29). For God, who is love, out of love is ever ready to serve us. He is patient, kind and always there for us; he suffers for our mistakes and seeks the way to help us improve. These are the characteristics of Christian service; meek and humble, it imitates God by serving others: by welcoming them with patient love and unflagging sympathy, by making them feel welcome and at home in the ecclesial community, where the greatest are not those who command but those who serve (cf. Lk 22:26). (Jubilee of Deacons, 29 May 2016)",

The true revolution of the family was done by him. And he also renewed, transformed, the family. (\u2026) We are told by an episode of the Gospel, where there is one of those words of Jesus that leave us disconcerted, that throw us into crisis. The three synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke tell it. Jesus is preaching in the midst of his disciples and other people, and at a certain point they say to him that his mother and his brethren are outside. (\u2026) He turns to those around him and says: \u201cHere are my mother and my brethren!\u201d, adding, \u201cFor whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother\u201d (cf. Mt 12:46-50; Mk 3:31-35; Lk 8:19-21). (\u2026) This word of Jesus radically renewed the family, so that the strongest, most important bond for us Christians is no longer that of blood, but of the love of Christ. His love transforms the family, freeing it from the dynamics of selfishness, which derive from the human condition and from sin; he frees it and enriches it with a new bond, even stronger but free, not dominated by the interests and conventions of kinship, but animated by gratitude, recognition, and reciprocal service.

This means that the experience of mission is part of Christian formation. This is how one should proclaim: by showing Jesus rather than talking about Jesus. And how do we show Jesus? With our witness. And finally, by going together, in community: the Lord sends all the disciples, but no one goes alone. The apostolic Church is completely missionary and in the mission it finds its unity. So: going forth, meek and good as lambs, without worldliness, and going together.

A baptized person who does not feel the need to proclaim the Gospel, to proclaim Jesus, is not a good Christian.\nThe second characteristic of the missionary\u2019s style is, so to speak, a face, which consists in the poverty of means. His accoutrement responds to a criteria of modesty. (\u2026) The Teacher wants them to be free and unhampered, without reserves and without favours, certain only of the love of the One who sends them, strengthened only by his Word which they go to proclaim.

And to this \u201cface\u201d also belongs the way the message is received: it can happen that one is not welcomed or listened to. This too is poverty: the experience of failure.

Vanity is like osteoporosis of the soul: the bones look good from the outside, but on the inside they are ruined. Furthermore: Vanity leads us to fraud. (Santa Marta, 22 September 2016)",
            "Vanity makes us bloat, but it does not last long, as it is like a bubble, and never brings any true gain. All of the things that he does are to pretend, out of vanity, and in the end what does he gain? This is vanity.

            "One cannot know Jesus without involving oneself with Him, without staking one's life on Him. When so many people \u2014 including us \u2014 ask this question \u2018Who is this?\u2019 the Word of God answers us: \u2018Do you want to know who this is? Read what the Church tells you about Him, talk to Him in prayer, and walk along His path with Him. Thus, you will know who this man is.\u2019 This is the path! Everyone must make his own choice!

            " \u201cAll is vanity\u201d, all is vanity: the refrain that comes and goes, all is vanity, all is \u201cfog\u201d, all is \u201csmoke\u201d, all is \u201cemptiness\u201d. It is surprising to find in Holy Scripture these expressions that question the meaning of existence. In reality, Qoheleth\u2019s continuous vacillation between sense and non-sense is the ironic representation of an awareness of life that is detached from the passion for justice, of which God\u2019s judgement is the guarantor. And the Book\u2019s conclusion points the way out of the trial: \u201cFear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man\u201d (12:13). This is the advice to resolve this problem.

            "Many people talk about Jesus. In those days, they said: \u201cJohn is risen from the dead\u2026 Elijah has appeared\u2026 one of the ancient prophets has arisen\u201d (Lk 9:7-8). All those people respected Jesus, but they didn\u2019t grasp his newness; they fit him into preconceived notions: John, Elijah, the prophets. Jesus, however, cannot be squeezed into the boxes of hearsay or d\u00e9ja vu. Jesus is always new, always.  The encounter with him always astonishes, and if you do not feel that astonishment in the encounter, you have not encountered Jesus. So many people in Europe see the faith as d\u00e9ja vu, a relic of the past. Why? Because they have not seen Jesus at work in their own lives. Often this is because we, by our lives, have not sufficiently shown him to them. God makes himself seen in the faces and actions of men and women transformed by his presence. If Christians, instead of radiating the contagious joy of the Gospel, keep speaking in an outworn intellectualistic and moralistic religious language, people will not be able to see the Good Shepherd. They will not recognize the One who loves each of his sheep, calls them by name, and bears them on his shoulders. (Mass with the Council of Bishops\u2019 Conference of Europe, 23 September 2021)",
            "And why, does Jesus create problems. \u201cYou cannot know Jesus, without having problems\u201d. You cannot know Jesus \u201cby sitting in first class\u201d or \u201cin the calm\u201d, much less \u201cin the library\u201d. We only come to know Jesus on the daily path of life. We can also come to know him in the Catechism.  \u201cIt is true! The Catechism, teaches us many things about Jesus, and we should study it, we should learn it\u201d. However, the fact remains that knowing about Jesus through the Catechism \u201cis not enough\u201d: knowing him with the mind is a step in the right direction, but \u201cin order to know Jesus, we need to enter into a dialogue with him. By talking with him, in prayer, on our knees. If you don't pray, if you don't talk to Jesus, you don't know him\u201d. Lastly, there is a third way to know Jesus: \u201cIt is by following him, by going with him, by walking with him, by travelling along the road of his ways\u201d. If you know Jesus with these three languages: of mind, heart and action, then you can say that you know Jesus\u201d. Therefore, in order truly to know him, it is necessary to read \u201cwhat the Church tells us about him, to speak with him in prayer and to walk along the path of his ways with him\u201d. This is the road and \u201ceveryone has a decision to make\u201d. (Santa Marta, 26 September 2013)"

With this prospect, which gives rise instinctively to repulsion, both in the disciples and in us who read the Gospel, prayer is the only source of light and strength. It is necessary to pray more intensely, every time the road takes an uphill turn. (General audience, 2 June 2021)",

If He were simply a person from the past. (\u2026)  He would merely be a good memory of a bygone time. And for Jesus, this will not do.

            "First of all, children remind us that we all, in the first years of life, were completely dependent upon the care and benevolence of others. The Son of God was not spared this stage. Thus, children are in and of themselves a treasure for humanity and also for the Church, for they constantly evoke that necessary condition for entering the Kingdom of God: that of not considering ourselves self-sufficient, but in need of help, of love, of forgiveness. We all are in need of help, of love and of forgiveness! Children remind us of another beautiful thing: they remind us that we are always sons and daughters. Even if one becomes an adult, or an elderly person, even if one becomes a parent, if one occupies a position of responsibility, underneath all of this is still the identity of a child. We are all sons and daughters. And this always brings us back to the fact that we did not give ourselves life but that we received it. The great gift of life is the first gift that we received. Sometimes in life we risk forgetting about this, as if we were the masters of our existence. (General Audience, 18 March 2015)",

The great gift of life is the first gift that we received. Sometimes in life we risk forgetting about this, as if we were the masters of our existence, and instead we are fundamentally dependent. In reality, it is a motive of great joy to feel at every stage of life, in every situation, in every social condition, that we are and we remain sons and daughters. This is the main message that children give us, by their very presence: simply by their presence they remind us that each and every one of us is a son or daughter. But there are so many gifts, so many riches that children bring to humanity. I shall mention only a few. They bring their way of seeing reality, with a trusting and pure gaze. A child has spontaneous trust in his father and mother; he has spontaneous trust in God, in Jesus, in Our Lady. At the same time, his interior gaze is pure, not yet tainted by malice, by duplicity, by the \u201cincrustations\u201d of life which harden the heart. We know that children are also marked by original sin, that they are selfish, but they preserve purity, and interior simplicity.

Tenderness is also poetry: it is \u201cfeeling\u201d things and events, not treating them as mere objects, only to use them, because they are useful. (...) For all these reasons Jesus invited his disciples to \u201cbecome like children\u201d, because \u201cthe Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like them\u201d (cf. Mt 18:3; Mk 10:14).

            "God has no difficulty in making Himself understood by children, and children have no difficulty in understanding God. It is not by chance that in the Gospel there are several very beautiful and powerful words of Jesus regarding the \u201clittle ones\u201d. This term, \u201cbabes\u201d, refers to all the people who depend on the help of others, and to children in particular. For example, Jesus says: (\u2026)  \u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones: for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven\u201d (Mt 18:10).\nThus, children are in and of themselves a treasure for humanity and also for the Church, for they constantly evoke that necessary condition for entering the Kingdom of God: that of not considering ourselves self-sufficient, but in need of help, of love, of forgiveness.

Among those who are weary of life, the Gospel also often includes the poor (cf. Mt 11:5) and the little ones (cf. Mt 18:6). This means those who cannot rely on their own means, nor on important friendships. They can only trust in God. Jesus proposes to his disciples a journey of knowledge and of imitation. Jesus is not a severe master who imposes upon others burdens which He does not bear. In order to save humanity Jesus did not undertake an easy path; on the contrary, his journey was painful and difficult. Dear brothers and sisters, for us too there are moments of weariness and disillusion. Then let us remember these words of the Lord, which give us so much consolation and allow us to understand whether we are placing our energy at the service of the good.

            "If we all stop and look into our hearts today, we would see how many times \u2014 how many! \u2014 we have closed our ears and how many times we have become deaf. And when a people, a community, but let us say, even a Christian community, a parish, a diocese closes its ears and becomes deaf to the Word of God, it seeks other voices, other lords, and it ends up involving idols, the idols which the world, worldliness, and society offer it. We become distant from the living God. It is a negative process which leads to not listening to the Word of God, to distancing oneself, and thus, to a hardened heart, closed within itself, to the point that it loses the sense of faithfulness. This not listening and turning our backs ... hardens our hearts, leads mankind on the path of unfaithfulness. Each of us today can ask him- or herself: \u2018Do I stop to listen to the Word of God? Do I take the Bible in my hands and is He talking to me?\u2019; and, \u2018has my heart become hardened? Have I distanced myself from the Lord? Have I lost my faithfulness to the Lord and do I live with the idols that everyday worldliness offers? Have I lost the joy of the marvel of the first encounter with Jesus?\u2019.

            "The Lord knows how arduous life can be. He knows that many things weary the heart: disappointments and wounds of the past, burdens to carry and wrongs to bear in the present, uncertainties and worries about the future. In the face of all this, Jesus\u2019 first word is an invitation, a call to move and respond: \u201cCome\u201d. The mistake, when things go wrong, is to stay where we are, lying there. In dark times it feels natural to keep to ourselves, to ruminate over how unfair life is, over how ungrateful others are, how mean the world is, and so on. Jesus, however, wants to pull us out of this \u201cquicksand\u201d and thus says to each one: \u201cCome! \u2014 Who? \u2014 You, you, you\u201d. The way out is in connecting, in extending a hand and lifting our gaze to those who truly love us. In fact it is not enough to come out of ourselves; it is important to know where to go. Because many aims are illusory: Therefore Jesus indicates where to go: \u201cCome to me\u201d. He awaits us; he always awaits us. Not to magically resolve problems, but to strengthen us amid our problems. Jesus does not lift the burdens from our life, but the anguish from our heart; he does not take away our cross, but carries it with us. (Angelus, 9 luglio 2017)",
            "Faith in God asks us to renew every day the choice of good over evil, the choice of the truth rather than lies, the choice of love for our neighbour over selfishness. Those who convert to this choice, after having experienced sin, will find the first places in the Kingdom of heaven, where there is greater joy for a single sinner who repents than for ninety-nine righteous people (cf. Lk 15:7). But conversion, changing the heart, is a process, a process that purifies us from moral encrustations. And at times it is a painful process, because there is no path of holiness without some sacrifice and without a spiritual battle. But this, even the smallest concrete commitment, cannot be made without grace. Conversion is a grace we must always ask for: \u201cLord, give me the grace to improve. Give me the grace to be a good Christian\u201d. (Angelus 27 September 2020)",

And Jesus weeps over each one of us when we live out our Christianity formally, not really. (\u2026) There is the hypocrisy of sinners, but the hypocrisy of the just is the fear of the love of Jesus, the fear of allowing ourselves to love.

We pretend to have Him, but we have cast him out. \u201cWe are Christians,\u201d [we say.] \u201cWe are proud to be Christians.\u201d But we live like pagans. (Santa Marta, 5 October 2018)",
            "God reveals himself by liberating and healing the human person. Let us not forget this: God reveals himself by liberating and healing the human person, and he does this with a gratuitous love, a love that saves. This is why Jesus praises his father, because his greatness consists in love and he never works outside of love. But this greatness in love is not understood by those who presume to be great and who fabricate a god in their own image \u2014 powerful, inflexible, vindictive. (\u2026)\nThe little children, instead, know how to welcome them, and Jesus praises the Father for them: \u201cI bless you,\u201d he says, because you have revealed the Kingdom of Heaven to the little ones. Jesus praises him for the simple people whose hearts are free from presumption and self-love. The little ones are those who, like children, feel their need and are not self-sufficient. They are open to God and allow themselves to be amazed at his works. They know how to read his signs, to marvel at the miracles of his love! (\u2026) If we think about it, our lives are filled with miracles. They are filled with deeds of love, signs of God\u2019s goodness. Before these, however, even our hearts can remain indifferent and become habitual, curious but not capable of being amazed, of allowing themselves to be \u201cimpressed\u201d. (\u2026) To impress is a beautiful verb that brings to mind photographic film. This is the correct behaviour to have before God\u2019s works: to take a photograph of his works in our minds so that they may be impressed in our hearts, and then developed in our lives through many good deeds, so that this \u201cphotograph\u201d of God, who is love, becomes ever brighter in us and through us.\nAnd now, let us all ask ourselves: In the deluge of news that overwhelms us, do I, as Jesus shows us today, know how to stop before the great things of God, those that God accomplishes? Do I allow myself to marvel like a child at the good that silently changes the world? Or have I lost the ability to be amazed? And do I bless the Father each day for his works?

            "The invincible patience of Jesus! Have you thought about the patience of God? Have you ever thought as well of his limitless concern for sinners? How it should lead us to impatience with ourselves! It\u2019s never too late to convert, never. God\u2019s patience awaits us until the last moment. Remember that little story from St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus, when she prayed for that man who was condemned to death, a criminal, who did not want to receive the comfort of the Church. He rejected the priest, he didn\u2019t want [forgiveness], he wanted to die like that. And she prayed in the convent, and when, at the moment of being executed, the man turned to the priest, took the Crucifix and kissed it. The patience of God! He does the same with us, with all of us. How many times, we don\u2019t know \u2014 we\u2019ll know in heaven \u2014 but how many times we are there, there ... [about to fall off the edge] and the Lord saves us. He saves us because he has great patience with us. And this is his mercy. It\u2019s never too late to convert, but it\u2019s urgent. Now is the time! Let us begin today. (Angelus 28 February 2016)",

But he adds: \u201cDo not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven\u201d (Lk 10:20). We should not boast as if we were the protagonists: there is only one protagonist, it is the Lord!  Dear friends, be glad! Do not be afraid of being joyful! Don't be afraid of joy! That joy which the Lord gives us when we allow him to enter our life. Let us allow him to enter our lives and invite us to go out to the margins of life and proclaim the Gospel.

When I see these simple people, these humble people who go on pilgrimages, who go to pray, who sing, who praise, people who perhaps lack many things but whose humility leads them to praise God. In the future of the world and in the hopes of the Church there are always the \u201clittle ones\u201d: those who do not consider themselves better than others, who are aware of their own limitations and their sins, who do not want to lord it over others, who, in God the Father, recognize that we are all brothers and sisters.

No. Rather, the man and the woman are called to recognize each other, to complete each other, to help each other in marriage. This teaching of Jesus is very clear and defends the dignity of marriage as a union of love which implies fidelity. What allows the spouses to remain united in marriage is a love of mutual giving supported by Christ\u2019s grace. However, if in the spouses, individual interests, one\u2019s own satisfaction prevails, then their union cannot endure. For this reason in these situations, the Church is not asked to express immediately and only condemnation.

In effect, hospitality is not composed of fine words, but demands that you roll up your sleeves, that everything necessary is done so the guest feels welcome. Jesus is well aware of this. And indeed, he acknowledges Martha\u2019s effort. However, he wants to make her understand that there is a new order of priorities, different from the one she had followed until then. Mary had sensed that there is a \u201cgood portion \u201d that must be accorded first place. Everything else comes after, like a stream flowing from the source.

At first sight it seems that he has come to receive, because he needs food and lodging, but in reality, the Master came to give himself to us through his word. The word of Jesus is not abstract; it is a teaching that touches and shapes our life, changes it, frees it from the opaqueness of evil, satisfies and infuses it with a joy that does not pass: Jesus\u2019 word is the good portion, that which Mary had chosen. Therefore, she gives it first place: she stops and listens. The rest will come after.

At times we begin the day automatically, we start doing things \u2026 like hens. No. We must start the day by first of all looking to the Lord, taking his Word, briefly, but allowing this to be the inspiration for the day.

            "There are many situations in which hypocrisy is at work. It is often hidden in the work place where one appears to be friends with one\u2019s colleagues, while competition leads them to stab them in the back. In politics, it is not unusual to find hypocrites who live one way in public and another way in private. Hypocrisy in the Church is particularly detestable; and unfortunately, hypocrisy exists in the Church and there are many hypocritical Christians and ministers. We should never forget the Lord\u2019s words: \u201cLet what you say be simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil\u201d (Mt 5:37).

And let us not be afraid to be truthful, to speak the truth, to hear the truth, to conform ourselves to the truth. In this way, we will be able to love. A hypocrite does not know how to love. To act other than truthfully means jeopardizing the unity of the Church, that unity for which the Lord himself prayed. (General audience, 25 August 2021)",
            "Jesus prayed with intensity in public moments, sharing the liturgy of his people, but also seeking withdrawn places, away from the turbulence of the world, places that allowed him to dwell in the privacy of his soul: he is the prophet who knows the stones of the desert and goes up high into the mountains. Jesus\u2019 last words before dying on the Cross are words from the psalms, that is, of prayer, the prayer of the Jews: he prayed with the prayers that his mother had taught him.\nJesus prayed like all men and women in the world pray. Yet his way of praying also contained a mystery, something that certainly did not escape the eyes of his disciples, since the Gospels contain that plea that was so simple and immediate: \u201cLord, teach us to pray\u201d (Lk 11:1). They see Jesus praying and they want to learn how to pray: \u201cLord, teach us to pray\u201d. And Jesus does not refuse, he is not possessive of his intimacy with the Father, but rather, he came precisely to introduce us to this relationship with the Father. And thus, he becomes the teacher of prayer to his disciples, as he undoubtedly wants to be so for all of us. We too should say: \u201cLord, teach me to pray. Teach me\u201d.

And many days of our life, faith seems to be an illusion, a barren struggle. There are moments of darkness in our life, and in those moments, faith seems to be an illusion.

Many saints experienced the night of faith and God\u2019s silence \u2014 when we knock and God does not respond \u2014 and these saints were persevering. During these nights of faith, those who pray are never alone. Indeed, Jesus is not only a witness and teacher of prayer; he is more.

            "With these words Jesus makes it understood that God always responds, that no prayer will remain unheard; why? Because He is Father, and does not forget his suffering children. Of course, these affirmations disconcert us, because many of our prayers seem not to obtain any results. How often have we asked and not received \u2014 we have all experienced this \u2014 how many times have we knocked and found a closed door? Jesus advises us, in those moments, to persist and to not give up. Prayer always transforms reality, always. If things around us do not change, at least we change; our heart changes. Jesus promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to each man and to each woman who prays.\nWe can be certain that God will respond. The only uncertainty is due to time, but let us not doubt that he will respond. Perhaps we will have to persist for our whole life, but he will respond. He promised us this: he is not like a father who gives a serpent instead of a fish. There is nothing more certain: the desire for happiness which we all carry in our heart will one day be fulfilled. (General audience, 9 January 2019)",
            "First of all, prayer must be tenacious: like the character in the parable who, having to welcome a guest who arrived unexpectedly in the middle of the night, goes to knock on the door of a friend and asks him for some bread. The friend responds, \u201cNo!\u201d, because he is already in bed \u2014 but he insists and insists until he forces his friend to get up and give him some bread (cf. Lk 11:5-8). A tenacious request. But God is more patient than we are, and those who knock with faith and perseverance on the door of his heart will not be disappointed. God always responds. Always. Our Father knows well what we need; insistence is necessary not to inform him or to convince him, but rather it is necessary to nurture the desire and expectation in us.

            "One of the most helpful virtues to practice in this regard is the virtue of vigilance. Jesus uses a striking example to illustrate the need for vigilance, attentiveness to ourselves and to the Church. He tells us: \u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place, but not finding any, it says, \u2018I will return to my house from which I came\u2019. (\u2026)  Our initial conversion follows a certain pattern: the evil that we acknowledge and try to uproot from our lives does indeed leave us, but we would be na\u00efve to think that it will long be gone. In short order, it comes back under a new guise. Before, it appeared rough and violent, now it shows up as elegant and refined. We need to realize that and once again to unmask it. Let me put it this way: they are \u201celegant demons\u201d: they enter smoothly, without our even being conscious of them. Only the daily practice of the examination of conscience can enable us to be aware of them. Hence the importance of the examination of conscience, to keep watch over our house.

            "We are Christians, Catholics who go to Mass and pray.  We do have our defects, our sins, but everything seems to be in order.  Acting like a polite person the demon goes about to find a weak point and knocks at the door, saying,  \"Excuse me? May I come in?\" and rings the bell.   And these polite demons are worse than the first ones, because you don't realize they are at home.  They are the worldly spirit, the spirit of the world. The devil either destroys directly with vices, wars or injustices or he does so politely and diplomatically the way Jesus describes.  Working silently, they make friends and persuade you on the road to mediocrity, making you \"lukewarm\" with worldliness. (Santa Marta, 12 October 2018)"

The Law however exists. (\u2026)\nHence, the Apostle\u2019s conviction is that the Law certainly possesses a positive function \u2014 as a pedagogue moving forward \u2014 but it is a function that is limited in time. Its duration cannot be extended too far because it is linked to the maturation of individuals and their choice of freedom. Once one has come to faith, the Law exhausts its propaedeutic value and must give way to another authority. What does this mean? That after the Law we can say, \u201cWe believe in Jesus Christ and do what we want\u201d? No! The Commandments exist, but they do not justify us. What justifies is Jesus Christ. The Commandments must be observed, but they do not give us justice; there is the gratuitousness of Jesus Christ, the encounter with Jesus Christ that freely justifies us. The merit of faith is receiving Jesus. The only merit: opening the heart. So what do we do with the Commandments? We must observe them, but as an aid to the encounter with Jesus Christ.

            "To listen to the Word of God and practise it, are the only two \u201cconditions\u201d established by Jesus for those who want to follow him. Christian life is \u201csimple, simple\u201d. Perhaps we have made it a bit difficult, with so many explanations that nobody understands, but the Christian life is like this: listening to the Word of God and practising it. (\u2026)\nEvery time we open the Gospel and read a passage and ask ourselves: \u2018Is God speaking to me with this, is he saying something to me\u2019?. This means \u201cto listen to the Word of God, to listen with the ears and listen with the heart, to open the heart to God\u2019s Word\u201d. On the other hand, \u201cJesus\u2019 enemies listened to Jesus\u2019 words but they were close by in order to try and find a mistake, to make him slip up\u201d and make him lose authority. But they never asked themselves: \u2018What is God telling me with these words\u2019?. Moreover, the Pontiff added, \u201cGod does not speak only to all but he speaks to each one of us. The Gospel was written for each one of us. (\u2026)\nThe Lord, \u201calways plants his Word\u201d, and in exchange \u201che asks only for an open heart to listen to it and good will to put it into practise. This is why today\u2019s prayer is that of the Psalm: \u2018Guide me, Lord, in the way of your commands\u2019, that is, on the path of your Word, so that, with your guidance, I may learn to practice it\u201d. (Santa Marta, 23 September 2014)",
            "In the passage we heard, Paul says that the Law was like a pedagogue. (\u2026) In the school system of antiquity, the pedagogue did not have the function we attribute to him today, namely that of supporting the education of a boy or a girl. At the time he was instead a slave whose task was to accompany the master\u2019s son to the teacher and then bring him home again. He was thus to protect him from danger and watch over him to ensure he did not behave badly. His function was rather disciplinary. When the boy became an adult, the pedagogue ceased his duties. (\u2026) Referring to the Law in these terms enables Saint Paul to clarify the role it played in the history of Israel. The Torah, that is, the Law, was an act of magnanimity by God towards his people. After the election of Abraham, the other great act was the Law: laying down the path to follow. It certainly had restrictive functions, but at the same time it had protected the people, it had educated them, disciplined them and supported them in their weakness\u2026 (\u2026) What does this mean? That after the Law we can say, \u201cWe believe in Jesus Christ and do what we want\u201d? No! The Commandments exist, but they do not justify us. What justifies is Jesus Christ.

The merit of faith is receiving Jesus. The only merit: opening the heart. So what do we do with the Commandments? We must observe them, but as an aid to the encounter with Jesus Christ.\nThis teaching on the value of the law is very important, and deserves to be considered carefully so as not to fall into misunderstandings and take false steps.

            "The Apostle presents two opposing fronts: on the one side, the \u201cworks of the flesh\u201d, and on the other, the \u201cfruit of the Spirit\u201d. What are the works of the flesh? They are behaviours that are contrary to the Spirit of God. The Apostle calls them works of the flesh not because there is something wrong or bad about our human bodies. Indeed, we have seen how much he insisted on the reality of the human flesh that Christ brought to the cross! Flesh is a word that indicates the person\u2019s earthly dimension, closed in on itself in a horizontal existence, where worldly instincts are followed and the door to the Spirit, who lifts us up and opens us up to God and others, is closed. But the flesh also reminds us that everything ages, that all things pass, wither, while the Spirit gives life. Thus, Paul lists the works of the flesh which refer to the selfish use of sexuality, to magical practices connected with idolatry and to all that undermines interpersonal relationships such as \u201cenmity, jealousy, dissension, divisions, factions, envy\u2026\u201d (cf. Gal 5:19-21). All of this is the fruit \u2014 let\u2019s say \u2014 of the flesh, of behaviour that is solely human, \u201csickly\u201d human. Because humans have their values, but all this is \u201csickly\u201d human.\nThe fruit of the Spirit, instead, is \u201clove, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control\u201d (Gal 5:22-23), as Paul says. Christians, who in baptism have \u201cput on Christ\u201d (Gal 3:27), are called to live as such. (General Audience, 27 October 2021)",

They live a double life. Jesus says: \u201cThey bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger (v. 4). This attitude sets a bad example of authority, which should instead derive its primary strength precisely from setting a good example.

God\u2019s Word proclaimed with this frankness, with this courage, is capable of forming God\u2019s people. The Word of God must be proclaimed through prayer, and this should be done always. In fact, without prayer, you may offer a good conference, good education, good, very good, but it is not God\u2019s Word. Indeed, only from a heart in prayer can God\u2019s Word issue forth. Prayer is therefore necessary so that the Lord may accompany the sowing of the Word, and the Lord may water the seed so that it may sprout.

( Holy Mass on the Solemnity of Pentecost, 8 june 2014)",
            "The Holy Spirit does not come to \u201cmake us His clients\u201d; He comes to point out how to access the Father, to remind us how to access the Father. That is what Jesus opened, what Jesus showed us. A spirituality of the Son alone or the Holy Spirit alone does not exist: the center is the Father. The Son is sent by the Father and returns to the Father. The Holy Spirit is sent by the Father to remind us and to teach us how to access the Father. (Homily, Santa Marta, 17 May 2020)",
            "Jesus healed many sick people, and the scribes wanted to make others believe that he did so not with the Spirit of God \u2014 as Jesus did \u2014 but with that of the Evil One, with the power of the devil. Jesus reacted with firm and clear words; he did not tolerate this, because those scribes, perhaps without realizing it, were falling into the gravest sin: denying and blaspheming against God\u2019s Love which is present and active in Jesus. And blasphemy, the sin against the Holy Spirit, is the one unforgivable sin \u2014 as Jesus said \u2014 because it comes from closing the heart to God\u2019s mercy which acts in Jesus.\nBut this episode contains an admonishment which is useful to all of us. Indeed, it can happen that deep envy of a person\u2019s goodness and good works can drive one to falsely accuse him or her. Here there is true, lethal poison: the malice with which, in a premeditated manner, one wants to destroy the good reputation of the other. May God free us from this terrible temptation! (Angelus, 10 June 2018)",
            "Without the constant presence and action of the Holy Spirit the Church could not live and could not carry out the task that the Risen Jesus entrusted to her: to go and make disciples of all nations (cf. Mt 28:19). Evangelizing is the Church\u2019s mission. It is not the mission of only a few, but it is mine, yours and our mission. The Apostle Paul exclaimed: \u201cWoe to me if I do not preach the Gospel!\u201d (1 Cor 9:16). We must all be evangelizers, especially with our life! Paul VI stressed that \u201cEvangelizing is... the grace and vocation proper to the Church, her deepest identity. She exists in order to evangelize\u201d (Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi, n. 14). Who is the real driving force of evangelization in our life and in the Church? Paul VI wrote clearly: \u201cit is the Holy Spirit who today, just as at the beginning of the Church, acts in every evangelizer who allows himself to be possessed and led by him. The Holy Spirit places on his lips the words which he could not find by himself, and at the same time the Holy Spirit predisposes the soul of the hearer to be open and receptive to the Good News and to the Kingdom being proclaimed (ibid., n. 75). To evangelize, therefore, it is necessary to open ourselves once again to the horizon of God\u2019s Spirit, without being afraid of what he asks us or of where he leads us. Let us entrust ourselves to him! He will enable us to live out and bear witness to our faith, and will illuminate the heart of those we meet. (General audience, 22 May 2013)",
            "The Holy Spirit guides us; He leads us to discern, to discern what we must do now, which is the right path and which is the wrong one, even in small decisions. If we ask for the light of the Holy Spirit, He will help us to discern so as to make the right decisions, the little everyday ones and the big ones. He will accompany us and support us in this discernment. Therefore, the Spirit teaches us: He will teach us everything, that is, He will make us grow in faith, He introduces us to the mystery. The Spirit reminds us: He reminds us of faith, He reminds us of our life; it is the Spirit who in this teaching and in this memory teaches us to discern the decisions we must make. And the Gospels give a name to this, to the Holy Spirit - yes, Paraclete, because He supports you, but another more beautiful name: the Gift of God. The Spirit is the Gift of God. The Spirit is indeed the gift. He will not leave you alone, He will send you a Paraclete who will sustain you and help you to progress, to remember, discern and grow. The Gift of God is the Holy Spirit. May the Lord help us to keep this Gift that He has given us in Baptism, and which we all have within. (Santa Marta, 11 May 2020)"

He shows us that he enjoys dominion because he is a servant, glory because he is capable of abasement, kingship because he is fully prepared to lay down his life. By his passion and death, he takes the lowest place, attains the heights of grandeur in service, and bestows this upon his Church. (Canonization Mass, 18 october 2015)",
            "Jesus knows that James and John are inspired by great enthusiasm for him and for the cause of the Kingdom, but he also knows that their expectations and their zeal are tarnished by the spirit of the world. Jesus forewarns that they will drink his cup and receive his baptism, that is, that they too, like the other Apostles, will take part in his cross, when their time comes. However, Jesus concludes: \u201cto sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared\u201d. As if to say: now follow me and learn how to love \u2018at a loss\u2019, and the heavenly Father will see to our reward. The way of love is always \u2018at a loss\u2019, because to love means to set aside egoism, self-referentiality, in order to serve others. (Angelus, 21 October 2018)",

We see that he did not remain above in heaven to look down on us from up there, but he lowered himself to wash our feet. God is love and love is humble, it does not exalt itself, but comes down like the rain that falls to earth and brings life. But how can we adopt the same direction as Jesus, going from raising ourselves up to immersing ourselves, from the mentality of prestige, worldly prestige, to that of service, Christian service? Dedication is needed, but that is not enough. It is difficult alone, but not impossible, for we have a strength within that helps us. It is the strength of Baptism, of that immersion in Jesus  that all of us have already received through grace that directs us, moving us to follow him instead of seeking our interests, but to put ourselves at the service of others. It is a grace, a fire that the Spirit has kindled in us that needs to be nurtured. Today, let us ask the Holy Spirit to renew the grace of Baptism in us, that immersion in Jesus, in his way of being, to be more like servants, to be servants like he has been with us.

            "Today\u2019s Gospel passage (cf. Lk 12:13-21) begins with the narrative of a man who stands up among the multitude and asks Jesus to settle a legal matter concerning a family inheritance. However, Jesus does not address the matter in his reply, but rather urges the people to eschew covetousness, that is, the greed of possession. In order to divert his listeners from this exhausting search for wealth, Jesus tells the parable of the foolish rich man who believes he is happy because he has had the good fortune to reap an exceptional harvest and he feels secure thanks to the goods he has accumulated. (\u2026) The rich man puts three considerations before his soul, that is, himself: the accumulated goods, the many years that these goods appear to ensure him, and thirdly tranquility and unrestrained enjoyment (cf v. 19). But the word that God addresses to him nullifies his plans. Instead of \u201cmany years\u201d, God points to the immediacy of \u201cthis night; tonight you will die\u201d. Instead of the \u201cenjoyment of life\u201d, He presents him with \u201csurrendering his life; you will render your life to God\u201d with the ensuing judgment. Regarding the reality of the ample goods accumulated on which the rich man had based everything, it becomes shrouded in sarcasm by the question: \u201cand the things you have prepared, whose will they be?\u201d (v. 20). (\u2026) The end of the parable as recounted by the Evangelist is uniquely effective: \u201cSo is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God\u201d (v. 21). It is a warning which reveals the horizon towards which we are called to look. Material goods are necessary \u2014 they are goods! \u2014, but they are a means to live honestly and in sharing with the neediest. Today, Jesus invites us to consider that wealth can enslave the heart and distract it from the true treasure which is in heaven. (Angelus, 4 August 2019)",

(\u2026)\nIt is understood that this does not mean estranging oneself from reality, but rather seeking the things that have true value: justice, solidarity, welcome, fraternity, peace, all things that make up the true dignity of mankind. It is a case of leading a life that is fulfilled not according to a worldly manner, but rather according to the style of the Gospel: to love God with all one\u2019s being, and love one\u2019s neighbour as Jesus loved him, that is, in service and in giving oneself. (\u2026)\nLove that is understood and lived in [the style of the Gospel] is the source of true happiness, whereas the exaggerated search for material goods and wealth is often a source of anxiety, adversity, abuse of power, war.

The lamp of faith requires being continuously nourished by the heart-to-heart encounter with Jesus in prayer and in listening to his Word. (\u2026) And in order to help us understand this attitude, Jesus recounts the parable of the servants who await the return of their master from the marriage feast (v. 36-40), thus presenting another aspect of vigilance: being ready for the last and definitive encounter with the Lord. Each of us will encounter, will find him/herself in that day of encounter. Each of us has their own date for the definitive encounter.

            "In the text of today\u2019s Gospel, Jesus speaks to his disciples about the attitude to assume in view of the final encounter with him, and explains that the expectation of this encounter should impel us to live a life full of good works. (\u2026) Jesus exhorts: \u201cYou also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect\u201d. The disciple is one who awaits the Lord and his Kingdom. (\u2026) In the first scene, the steward faithfully carries out his tasks and receives compensation. In the second scene, the steward abuses his authority, and beats the servants, for which, upon the master\u2019s unexpected return, he will be punished. This scene describes a situation that is also frequent in our time: so much daily injustice, violence and cruelty are born from the idea of behaving as masters of the lives of others. We have only one master who likes to be called not \u201cmaster\u201d but \u201cFather\u201d. We are all servants, sinners and children: He is the one Father. (\u2026) Jesus reminds us (\u2026) that the expectation of the eternal beatitude does not relieve us of the duty to render the world more just and more liveable. On the contrary, this very hope of ours of possessing the eternal Kingdom impels us to work to improve the conditions of earthly life, especially of our weakest brothers and sisters. May the Virgin Mary help us not to be people and communities dulled by the present, or worse, nostalgic for the past, but striving toward the future of God, toward the encounter with him, our life and our hope. (Angelus, 7 August 2016)",
            "This (\u2026) Gospel (Lk 12:32-48) speaks to us about the desire for the definitive encounter with Christ, a desire that keeps us ever ready, alert in spirit, for we anticipate this encounter with all our heart, with all our being. This is a fundamental aspect of life. It is a desire that we all share, whether explicit or secret, we have hidden in our heart; we all harbour this desire in our heart. It is also important to see Jesus\u2019 teaching in the actual context in which he transmitted it. In this case, Luke the Evangelist shows us Jesus walking with his disciples to Jerusalem, walking to his death and resurrection at Easter, and on this journey he teaches them, confiding to them what he himself carries in his heart, the deep attitude of his heart: detachment from earthly possessions, his trust in the Father\u2019s Providence and, indeed, his innermost watchfulness, all the while working for the Kingdom of God. For Jesus it is waiting for his return to the Father\u2019s house. For us it is waiting for Christ himself who will come to take us to the everlasting celebration, as he did for his Mother, Mary Most Holy; he took her up to Heaven with him.

            "At this moment I am thinking with admiration especially of the many priests, men and women religious and lay faithful who, throughout the world, are dedicated to proclaiming the Gospel with great love and faithfulness, often even at the cost of their lives. Their exemplary testimony reminds us that the Church does not need bureaucrats and diligent officials, but passionate missionaries, consumed by ardour to bring to everyone the consoling word of Jesus and his grace. This is the fire of the Holy Spirit. If the Church does not receive this fire, or does not let it inflame her, she becomes a cold or merely lukewarm Church, incapable of giving life, because she is made up of cold and lukewarm Christians. It will do us good today to take five minutes to ask ourselves: \u201cHow is my heart? Is it cold? Is it lukewarm? Is it capable of receiving this fire?\u201d. Let us take five minutes for this. It will do everyone good. (Angelus, 14 August 2016)",
            "But why is this door narrow, one might ask? Why does he say it is narrow? It is a narrow door not because it is oppressive, but because it demands that we restrain and limit our pride and our fear, in order to open ourselves to Him with humble and trusting hearts, acknowledging that we are sinners and in need of his forgiveness. This is why it is narrow, to limit our pride, which swells us. The door of God\u2019s mercy is narrow but is always open to everyone! God does not have preferences, but always welcomes everyone, without distinction. (Angelus, 21 August 2016)",

The difficulties in our lives are not resolved by watering down the truth. The truth is this: Jesus has brought fire, and struggle. What am I going to do? (Santa Marta, 26 October 2017) ",
            "The Church is human, but it is not merely a human organization, it is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Jesus brought the fire of the Spirit to the earth and the Church is reformed by the anointing of grace, the gratuity of the anointing of grace, the power of prayer, the joy of mission and the disarming beauty of poverty. Let us put God in first place! (Homily, Solemnity of Pentecost, 23 May 2021)",

            "He came to \u201cseparate with fire\u201d. To separate what? Good from evil, the just from the unjust. In this sense he came to \u201cdivide\u201d, to cause \u201cuneasiness\u201d \u2014 albeit in a healthy way \u2014 in his disciples\u2019 lives, breaking the facile illusions of those who think they can combine Christian life with worldliness, Christian life with compromises of all kinds, piety with a hostile attitude to others. Combining, some think, true religiosity with superstitious practices: how many so-called Christians go to fortune tellers to have their palms read! And this is superstition. It is not God. One must not live in a hypocritical way but be willing to pay the price for choices that are consistent \u2014 this is the attitude that each of us should seek in life: [being] consistent \u2014 paying the price for being consistent with the Gospel. (Angelus, 18 August 2019)",
            "Jesus says to his disciples: \u201cDo you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division\u201d (Lk 12:51). What does this mean? It means that faith is not a decorative or ornamental element; living faith does not mean decorating life with a little religion, as if it were a cake and we were decorating it with cream. No, this is not faith. Faith means choosing God as the criterion and basis of life, and God is not empty, God is not neutral, God is always positive, God is love, and love is positive! After Jesus has come into the world it is impossible to act as if we do not know God, or as if he were something that is abstract, empty, a purely nominal reference. No, God has a real face, he has a name: God is mercy, God is faithfulness, he is life which is given to us all. For this reason Jesus says \u201cI came to bring division\u201d. It is not that Jesus wishes to split people up. On the contrary Jesus is our peace, he is our reconciliation! But this peace is not the peace of the tomb, it is not neutrality, Jesus does not bring neutrality, this peace is not a compromise at all costs. Following Jesus entails giving up evil and selfishness and choosing good, truth and justice, even when this demands sacrifice and the renunciation of our own interests. And this indeed divides; as we know, it even cuts the closest ties. However, be careful: it is not Jesus who creates division! He establishes the criterion: whether to live for ourselves or to live for God and for others; to be served or to serve; to obey one\u2019s own ego or to obey God. It is in this sense that Jesus is a \u201csign that is spoken against\u201d (Lk 2:34). This word of the Gospel does not therefore authorize the use of force to spread the faith. It is exactly the opposite: the Christian\u2019s real force is the force of truth and of love, which involves renouncing all forms of violence. Faith and violence are incompatible! Instead, faith and strength go together. Christians are not violent; they are strong. And with what kind of strength? That of meekness, the strength of meekness, the strength of love. (Angelus, 18 August 2013)",
            "The Gospel for this Sunday (Lk 12:49-53) is part of Jesus\u2019 teachings to the disciples during his journey to Jerusalem, where death on the cross awaits him. (\u2026)  The fire that Jesus speaks of is the fire of the Holy Spirit, the presence living and working in us from the day of our Baptism. It \u2014 the fire \u2014 is a creative force that purifies and renews, that burns all human misery, all selfishness, all sin, which transforms us from within, regenerates us and makes us able to love.

These two attitudes lead the Church to be a functional Church, which never takes risks. Instead, the apostolic courage that the Holy Spirit kindles in us like a fire helps us to overcome walls and barriers, makes us creative and spurs us to get moving in order to walk even on uncharted or arduous paths, offering hope to those we meet.

            "We are always in need of salvation. And all of us should take this step every day: from beggars to disciples. And thus, the blind man sets out behind the Lord, becoming part of his community. The one they wanted to silence now witnesses aloud to his encounter with Jesus of Nazareth, and \u201call the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God\u201d. Let us also allow ourselves to be called by Jesus, and let us be healed by Jesus, forgiven by Jesus, and let us follow Jesus, praising God. So be it! (General audience, June 15th 2016)",
            "Faith, as we have seen with Bartimaeus, is a cry. Lack of faith is the suppression of that cry. That attitude that the people had, in making him keep quiet: they were not people of faith, whereas he was. To suppress that cry is a type of omert\u00e0. Faith is a protest against a pitiful condition the cause of which we do not understand. Lack of faith is to limit ourselves to endure a situation to which we have become accustomed. Faith is the hope of being saved. Lack of faith is becoming accustomed to the evil that oppresses us and continuing in that way. (General Audience, 6 May 2020)",
            "Greater than any discussion to the contrary, there is a voice in mankind\u2019s heart that invokes. We all have this voice within. A voice that comes forth spontaneously without anyone commanding it, a voice that asks itself about the meaning of our journey on earth, especially when we find ourselves in darkness: \u201cJesus, have mercy on me! Jesus have mercy on me!\u201d. This is a beautiful prayer. (General Audience, 6 May 2020)",
            "God always listens to the cry of the poor and is not at all disturbed by Bartimaeus\u2019 voice; rather, he realises it is full of faith, a faith that is not afraid to insist, to knock on the door of God\u2019s heart, despite not being understood and being reproached. And here lies the root of the miracle. Indeed, Jesus says to him: \u201cYour faith has made you well\u201d. Let each of us ask ourselves: \u201cWhat is my prayer like\u201d? Is it courageous, does it contain the good insistence of Bartimaeus, does it know how to \u201ctake hold\u201d of the Lord as he passes, or is it rather content with making a formal greeting every now and then, when I remember? Those lukewarm prayers that do not help at all. Furthermore, is my prayer \u201csubstantial\u201d, does it bare my heart before the Lord? Do I take my story and life experience to him? Or is it anaemic, superficial, made up of rituals, without feeling and without heart? (Angelus, 24 October 2021)",
            "\u201cJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.\u201d Let us, too, recite this prayer today. Let us repeat it and ask ourselves: \u201cWhat is my prayer like\u201d? Let each of us ask ourselves: \u201cWhat is my prayer like\u201d? Is it courageous, does it contain the good insistence of Bartimaeus, does it know how to \u201ctake hold\u201d of the Lord as he passes, or is it rather content with making a formal greeting every now and then, when I remember? Those lukewarm prayers that do not help at all. Furthermore, is my prayer \u201csubstantial\u201d, does it bare my heart before the Lord? Do I take my story and life experience to him? Or is it anaemic, superficial, made up of rituals, without feeling and without heart? When faith is alive, prayer is heartfelt: it does not beg for spare change, it is not reduced to the needs of the moment. We must ask everything of Jesus, who can do everything. Do not forget this. We must ask everything of Jesus, with my insistence before Him. He cannot wait to pour out his grace and joy into our hearts; but unfortunately, it is we who keep our distance, through timidness, laziness or unbelief. (Angelus, 24 October 2021)",
            "Bartimaeus\u2019 faith is evident from his prayer. It is not a timid and standard prayer. First and foremost, he calls the Lord \u201cSon of David\u201d: that is, he acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah, the King who would come into the world. Then he calls Him by name, confidently; \u201cJesus\u201d. He is not afraid of Him, he does not stay at a distance. And thus, from the heart, he shouts out his entire drama to God, his friend: \u201cHave mercy on me\u201d! Just that prayer: \u201cHave mercy on me\u201d! He does not ask for some loose change as he does with passers-by. No. He asks for everything from the One who can do everything. He asks people for loose change; he asks everything from Jesus who can do everything. \u201cHave mercy on me, have mercy on all that I am\u201d. He does not ask for a grace, but presents himself: he asks for mercy on his person, on his life. It is not a small request, but it is very beautiful because it is a cry for mercy, that is, compassion, God\u2019s mercy, his tenderness. (\u2026) Let us ask everything to the One who can give us everything, like Bartimaeus, who was a great teacher, a great teacher of prayer. May Bartimaeus, with his genuine, insistent and courageous faith, be an example for us. And may Our Lady, the prayerful Virgin, teach us to turn to God with all our heart, confident that he listens attentively to every prayer. (Angelus, 24 October 2021)"

And these are the words of a child of light\u201d. Are our words hypocrisy? Taking a little from here, a little from there, to fit in with everyone? Then they are vacuous, of no substance, empty. Are they vulgar words, trivial, or worldly? A dirty, obscene word? These four [types] of words are not of the children of light, they are not the Holy Spirit, they are not of Jesus, they are not words of the Gospel \u2026 They are the Christians of gray areas. And these Christians of gray areas are on one side first and then the other. People say of these: 'Is this person with God or the devil?' Huh? Always in the grey area. They are lukewarm. They are neither light nor dark. And God does not love these. In Revelation, the Lord says to these Christians of gray areas: 'No, you are neither hot nor cold. If only you were hot or cold. But because you are lukewarm \u2013 always in the gray areas- I will vomit you out of my mouth'. 'I am a Christian, but without overdoing it!' they say, and in doing so cause so much harm, because their Christian witness is a witness that in the end only sows confusion, it sows a negative witness\". (Saint Marta, 27 october 2014)",
            "With these words, Jesus wants to caution us too, today, against the belief that outward observance of the law is enough to make us good Christians. Dangerous as it was then for the Pharisees, so too is it for us to consider ourselves acceptable or, even worse, better than others simply for observing the rules, customs, even if we do not love our neighbour, are hard of heart, are arrogant and proud. Literal observance of the precepts is a fruitless exercise which does not change the heart and turn into practical behaviour. (Angelus, 30 August 2015)",
            "Rigidity is not a gift from God; meekness, goodness, benevolence, forgiveness, yes; but rigidity, no! Behind the rigidity there is always something hidden, in many cases a double life. Let us pray to the Lord and for our brothers and sisters who believe that walking in the law of the Lord is to become rigid. May the Lord may make them feel that He is their Father and that He delights in mercy, tenderness, goodness, meekness and humility. And may He teach all of us to walk in the law of the Lord with these attitudes. (Homily, Santa Marta \u2013 24 October 2016)",
            "What is hypocrisy? When we say, \u201cBe careful, that person is a hypocrite\u201d, what are we trying to say? What is hypocrisy? It can be called the fear of the truth. Hypocrites are afraid of the truth. They prefer to pretend rather than be themselves. It is like applying makeup on your soul, like putting makeup on your behaviour, putting makeup on how to proceed: it is not the truth. \u201cI am afraid of proceeding as I am and I put make up on my behaviour\u201d. To pretend hinders the courage to openly speak the truth; and thus, the obligation to speak the truth at all times, everywhere and in spite of anything, can easily be escaped. Pretending leads to this: to half-truths. And half-truths are a sham because the truth is the truth or it is not the truth. (General audience, 25 August 2021)",
            "Hypocrisy is the greatest danger because it can ruin even the most sacred realities. (\u2026)Therefore, prowess is not important to welcome God, but rather humility. This is the path to welcome God. Not prowess: \u201cWe are strong, We are great people...\u201d! No. Humility. \u201cI am a sinner\u201d. But not in an abstract way, no \u2014 \u201cbecause of this and this and this\u201d. Each of us has to confess our own sins, our own failings, our own hypocrisy, firstly to ourselves. We have to get off the pedestal and immerse ourselves in the water of repentance. (\u2026) We forget that it is legitimate to look down on someone else only in one case: when it is necessary to help them get up. (\u2026) This is how to begin a new life. There is only one way, the way of humility \u2014 to purify ourselves from the sense of superiority, from formalism and hypocrisy, to see others as our brothers and sisters, sinners like ourselves, and to see Jesus as the Saviour who comes for us, not for others, for us, just as we are, with our poverty, misery and failings, above all with our need to be raised up, forgiven and saved.

            "In the language of the Gospel, the seed is the symbol of the Word of God, whose fruitfulness is recalled in this parable. The Word of God makes things grow, it gives life. Please don\u2019t ever forget this. Because this is the power that makes the life of the Kingdom of God sprout within us. ). And thus is the Kingdom of God: a humanly small and seemingly irrelevant reality. To become a part of it, one must be poor of heart; not trusting in their own abilities, but in the power of the love of God; not acting to be important in the eyes of the world, but precious in the eyes of God, who prefers the simple and the humble. When we live like this, the strength of Christ bursts through us and transforms what is small and modest into a reality that leavens the entire mass of the world and of history. This opens us up to trust and hope, despite the tragedies, the injustices, the sufferings that we encounter. The seed of goodness and peace sprouts and develops, because the merciful love of God makes it ripen. (Angelus, 14 june 2015)",
            "Jesus compares the Kingdom of God to a mustard seed. It is a very small seed, yet it grows to become the greatest of all the plants in the garden: an unforeseeable, surprising growth. It is not easy for us to understand this logic of the unforeseeable nature of God and accept it into our life. But today, the Lord exhorts us to an attitude of faith which exceeds all our plans. God is always the God of surprises. In our communities it is important to pay attention to the little and big occasions of goodness that the Lord offers us, allowing ourselves to engage in His loving dynamics, of welcoming and of mercy toward others. (Angelus, 17 June 2018)",
            "At times history, with its events and its protagonists, seems to go in the opposite direction of the design of the heavenly Father, who wants justice, fraternity and peace for all his children. But we are called to live out these periods as seasons of trial, of hope and of vigilant expectation of the harvest. Indeed, yesterday like today, the Kingdom of God grows in the world in a mysterious way, in a surprising way, revealing the hidden power of the little seed, its victorious vitality. Within the folds of personal and social events which at times seem to signal the failure of hope, it is important to remain confident in God\u2019s subdued but powerful way of acting. For this reason, in moments of darkness and of difficulty we must not lose heart, but remain anchored in faithfulness to God, to his ever-saving presence. Remember this: God always saves. He is the Saviour. (Angelus \u2013 17 June 2018)",
            "At times, the din of the world, along with the many activities that fill our days, prevent us from stopping and seeing how the Lord is conducting history. Yet \u2014 the Gospel assures us \u2014 God is at work, like a good little seed that silently and slowly germinates. And, little by little, it becomes a lush tree, which gives life and rest to everyone. The seed of our good works too can seem like a small thing, yet all that is good pertains to God, and thus it humbly, slowly bears fruit. Good, let us remember, always grows in a humble way, in a hidden, often invisible way. (Angelus, 13 June 2021)",
            "Hope is this living in tension, always; knowing that we cannot make a nest here: the life of the Christian is \"in ongoing tension\". If a Christian loses this perspective, his life becomes static and things that do not move are motionless. Let's think of water: when the water is still, it doesn't run, it doesn't move, it stagnates. A Christian who is not capable of being out stretched, of being in tension, is missing something: he will end up stagnant. For him, the Christian life will be a philosophical doctrine, he will live it like that, he will say that it is faith but without hope it is not. (\u2026)\nIf we want to be men and women of hope, we must be poor, poor, not attached to anything. Poor. And open. Hope is humble, and it is a virtue that we work at - so to speak - every day: every day we have to take it back, every day we have to take the rope and see that the anchor is fixed there and I hold it in my hand; every day we have to remember that we have the security, that it is the Spirit who works in us with small things. (\u2026)\nFor this reason, hope is a virtue that cannot be seen: it works from below; it makes us go and look from below. It is not easy to live in hope, but I would say that it should be the air that a Christian breathes, the air of hope; on the other hand, he cannot walk, he cannot go on because he does not know where to go. Hope - yes, it's true - gives us security: hope does not disappoint. Never. If you hope, you will not be disappointed. We must open ourselves up to that promise of the Lord, leaning towards that promise, but knowing that there is the Spirit that works in us. May the Lord give us, to all of us, this grace of living in tension, in tension but not through nerves, problems, no: in tension through the Holy Spirit who throws us to the other shore and keeps us in hope. (Santa Marta, 29 October 2019)",
            "St Paul, in the Letter to the Ephesians, emphasizes that a great mystery is reflected in Christian spouses: the relationship established by Christ with the Church, a nuptial relationship (cf. Eph 5:21-33). (\u2026)\nThere is a truly marvellous design inherent in the Sacrament of Matrimony! And it unfolds in the simplicity and frailty of the human condition. We are well aware of how many difficulties two spouses experience.... The important thing it to keep alive their bond with God, who stands as the foundation of the marital bond. And the true bond is always the Lord. When the family prays, the bond is preserved. When the husband prays for his wife and the wife prays for her husband, that bond becomes strong; one praying for the other. It is true that there are so many difficulties in married life, so many. (\u2026) The secret is that love is stronger than the moment when there is arguing, and therefore I always advise spouses: do not let a day when you have argued end without making peace. Always! And to make peace it isn\u2019t necessary to call the United Nations to come to the house and make peace. A little gesture is sufficient, a caress, and then let it be! Until tomorrow! And tomorrow begin again. And this is life, carrying on, carrying on with courage and the desire to live together. And this is truly great, it is beautiful! Married life is such a beautiful thing and we must treasure it always, treasure the children. (General audience, 2 April 2014)"

            "The image of the door recurs in the Gospel on various occasions and calls to mind the door of the house, of the home, where we find safety, love and warmth. Jesus tell us that there is a door which gives us access to God\u2019s family, to the warmth of God\u2019s house, of communion with him. This door is Jesus himself (cf. Jn 10:9). He is the door. He is the entrance to salvation. He leads us to the Father and the door that is Jesus is never closed. This door is never closed it is always open and to all, without distinction, without exclusion, without privileges. Because, you know, Jesus does not exclude anyone. In our day we pass in front of so many doors that invite us to come in, promising a happiness which later we realize lasts only an instant, exhausts itself with no future. I would like to say forcefully: let\u2019s not be afraid to cross the threshold of faith in Jesus, to let him enter our life more and more, to step out of our selfishness, our closure, our indifference to others. Of course Jesus\u2019 door is a narrow one but not because it is a torture chamber. No, not for that reason! Rather, because he asks us to open our hearts to him, to recognize that we are sinners in need of his salvation, his forgiveness and his love in order to have the humility to accept his mercy and to let ourselves be renewed by him. (Angelus, 25 august 2013)",
            "But why is this door narrow, one might ask? Why does he say it is narrow? It is a narrow door not because it is oppressive, but because it demands that we restrain and limit our pride and our fear, in order to open ourselves to Him with humble and trusting hearts, acknowledging that we are sinners and in need of his forgiveness. This is why it is narrow, to limit our pride, which swells us. The door of God\u2019s mercy is narrow but is always open to everyone! God does not have preferences, but always welcomes everyone, without distinction. (Angelus, 21 August 2016)",

But where is the door? Who is the door? Jesus himself is that door. He says so in the Gospel of John: \u201cI am the door\u201d (10:9). He leads us to communion with the Father, where we find love, understanding and protection. But why is this door narrow, one might ask? Why does he say it is narrow? It is a narrow door not because it is oppressive, but because it demands that we restrain and limit our pride and our fear, in order to open ourselves to Him with humble and trusting hearts, acknowledging that we are sinners and in need of his forgiveness. This is why it is narrow, to limit our pride, which swells us. The door of God\u2019s mercy is narrow but is always open to everyone! He awaits each one of us, no matter what sins we have committed, to embrace us, to offer us his forgiveness. He alone can transform our hearts, He alone can give full meaning to our existence, giving us true joy. By entering Jesus\u2019 door, the door of faith and of the Gospel, we can leave behind worldly attitudes, bad habits, selfishness and narrow-mindedness. (Angelus, 21 august 2016)",

It is a \u201cnarrow doorway\u201d because it is demanding. Love is always demanding. It requires commitment, indeed, \u201ceffort\u201d, that is, a determined and persevering willingness to live according to the Gospel. Saint Paul calls it \u201cthe good fight of the faith\u201d (1 Tim 6:12). It takes a daily, all-day effort to love God and neighbour. (\u2026)\nNo, claims do not count, they do not count. The Lord will recognize us only for our humble life and a good life, a life of faith that resulted in good works. (Angelus, 25 August 2019)"

            "The first two days of the month of November constitute for all of us an intense moment of faith, prayer and reflection on the \u201clast things\u201d of life. Today we praise God for the countless host of saints from all ages: simple and ordinary men and women, who were at times \u201clast\u201d for the world, but \u201cfirst\u201d for God. At the same time we remember our departed loved ones by visiting the cemeteries: it is a source of great consolation to think that they are in the company of the Virgin Mary, the apostles, the martyrs and all the saints of Heaven! We, here on earth, along with those who have entered into eternity, form one great family. nd it is comforting to know that there are other brothers and sisters who have already reached heaven, who await us and pray for us, so that together in eternity we can contemplate the glorious and merciful face of the Father. In the great assembly of saints, God wanted to reserve the first place for the Mother of Jesus. Mary is at the centre of the communion of saints, as the singular custodian of the bond between the universal Church and Christ, of the bond of the family. She is Mother, She is our Mother, our Mother. For those who want to follow Jesus on the path of the Gospel, she is a trusted guide because she is the first disciple. She is an attentive and caring Mother, to whom we can entrust every desire and difficulty. (Angelus, 1 november 2014)",

They are the saints. Therefore, today is a family celebration. The saints are close to us, indeed they are our truest brothers and sisters. They understand us, love us, know what is truly good for us, help us and await us. They are happy and want us to be happy with them in paradise. Thus they invite us on the path of happiness, indicated by today\u2019s beautiful and well-known Gospel passage: \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit.... Blessed are the meek.... Blessed are the pure in heart...\u201d (cf. Mt 5:3-8). This way of the Beatitudes, of holiness, seems to always lead to defeat. Yet \u2014 the first reading also reminds us \u2014 the Saints hold \u201cpalm branches in their hands\u201d (Rev 7:9), which is a symbol of victory. They have prevailed, not the world. And they exhort us to choose their side, that of God who is HolyToday our brothers and sisters do not ask us to listen to another fine Gospel passage, but to put it into practice, to set out on the way of the Beatitudes. It is not a matter of doing extraordinary things, but of following, each day, this way that leads us to heaven, leads us to family, leads us home. (Angelus, 1 Decembre 2018)",

This message was already present in the preaching of the prophets: God is close to the poor and the oppressed, and delivers them from those who oppress them. But Jesus\u2019s preaching, He follows a particular path. The poor, in this evangelical sense, appear to be those who keep alive the objective of the Kingdom of Heaven, offering a glimpse of it revealed as a seed in the fraternal community which favours sharing over ownership. (Angelus 29 January 2017)",
            "Today we celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints. In the light of this feast day, let us pause and think a little about holiness, in particular about two of the characteristics of true holiness: it is a gift \u2014 it is a gift, it cannot be bought \u2014 and at the same time it is a journey. A gift and a journey. First of all, a gift. Holiness is a gift from God which we have received with Baptism: if we let it grow, it can completely change our life (cf. Apostolic Exhortation Gaudate et exsultate, 15). Saints are not unreachable (\u2026) Indeed, if we think about it, we have certainly met some of them, some everyday saints: some righteous person, someone who lives the Christian life seriously, with simplicity. (\u2026) Holiness is a gift offered to everyone for a happy life. And after all, when we receive a gift, what is our first reaction? It is precisely that we are happy, because it means that someone loves us; and the gift of holiness makes us happy because God loves us. (\u2026) Holiness is also a journey, a journey to be made together, helping each other, united with those excellent companions who are the saints. (Angelus, 1 Nov 2023)"

In effect, the visible sign a Christian can show in order to witness to his love for God to the world and to others, to his family, is the love he bears for his brothers, is the love of his people. The Commandment to love God and neighbour is the first, not because it is at the top of the list of Commandments. Jesus does not place it at the pinnacle but at the centre, because it is from the heart that everything must go out and to which everything must return and refer.\nIn the Old Testament, the requirement to be holy, in the image of God who is holy, included the duty to care for the most vulnerable people, such as the stranger, the orphan and the widow (cf. Ex 22:20-26). Jesus brings this Covenant law to fulfilment; He who unites in himself, in his flesh, divinity and humanity, a single mystery of love.\nNow, in the light of this Word of Jesus, love is the measure of faith, and faith is the soul of love. We can no longer separate a religious life, a pious life, from service to brothers and sisters, to the real brothers and sisters that we encounter. (Angelus, 26 October 2014)",
            "\u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.... You shall love your neighbour as yourself\u201d (Mk 12:30-31).\nIn choosing these two Words addressed by God to his people and by putting them together, Jesus taught once and for all that love for God and love for neighbour are inseparable; moreover, they sustain one another. Even if set in a sequence, they are two sides of a single coin: experienced together they are a believer\u2019s strength! To love God is to live of him and for him, for what he is and for what he does. Our God is unmitigated giving; he is unlimited forgiveness; he is a relationship that promotes and fosters. Therefore, to love God means to invest our energies each day to be his assistants in the unmitigated service of our neighbour, in trying to forgive without limitations, and in cultivating relationships of communion and fraternity.\nThis challenges our Christian communities: it means avoiding the risk of being communities that have many initiatives but few relationships; the risk of being community \u2018service stations\u2019 but with little company, in the full and Christian sense of this term.\nGod, who is love, created us to love and so that we can love others while remaining united with him. It would be misleading to claim to love our neighbour without loving God; and it would also be deceptive to claim to love God without loving our neighbour. (Angelus, 4 November 2018)"

Any disciple, whether a layman or laywoman, a priest or a bishop: an all-absorbing relationship. Perhaps the first question that we must ask a Christian is: \u201cDo you meet with Jesus? Do you pray to Jesus?\u201d. Those who allow themselves to be drawn into this bond of love and of life with the Lord Jesus become his representatives, his \u201cambassadors\u201d, above all in the way of being, of living. It is important that the people be able to perceive that for that disciple Jesus is truly \u201cthe Lord\u201d; He is truly the centre of his or her life, the everything of life. It does not matter then if, as for every human being, he or she has limitations and even makes mistakes \u2014 as long as he or she has the humility to recognize them; the important thing is that they not have a duplicitous heart \u2014 and this is dangerous. his is why Jesus prays to the Father so that the disciples may not fall prey to the worldly spirit. You are either with Jesus, with the spirit of Jesus, or you are with the spirit of the world. (Angelus, 2 July 2017)",

            "This is the same decision we must make if we want to be disciples of Jesus. What does this decision consist of? For we must be serious disciples of Jesus, truly decisive, not \u201clukewarm\u201d, as an old woman I knew used to say. No! Decisive Christians. (Angelus, 26 June 2022)",
            "In today\u2019s Gospel Jesus insists on the conditions for being his disciples: preferring nothing to the love of Christ, carrying one\u2019s cross and following him. Many people in fact drew near to Jesus, they wanted to be included among his followers; and this would happen especially after some miraculous sign which accredited him as the Messiah, the King of Israel. However Jesus did not want to disappoint anyone. He knew well what awaited him in Jerusalem and which path the Father was asking him to take: it was the Way of the Cross, the way of sacrificing himself for the forgiveness of our sins. Following Jesus does not mean taking part in a triumphal procession! It means sharing his merciful love, entering his great work of mercy for each and every man and for all men. The work of Jesus is, precisely, a work of mercy, a work of forgiveness and of love! Jesus is so full of mercy! And this universal pardon, this mercy, passes through the Cross. Jesus, however, does not want to do this work alone: he wants to involve us too in the mission that the Father entrusted to him. After the Resurrection he was to say to his disciples: \u201cAs the Father has sent me, even so I send you\u201d... if you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven\u201d (Jn 20:21-22). Jesus\u2019 disciple renounces all his possessions because in Jesus he has found the greatest Good in which every other good receives its full value and meaning: family ties, other relationships, work, cultural and economic goods and so forth.... The Christian detaches him or herself from all things and rediscovers all things in the logic of the Gospel, the logic of love and of service. (Angelus, 8 Sept 2013)",
            "Jesus\u2019 disciple renounces all his possessions because in Jesus he has found the greatest Good in which every other good receives its full value and meaning. (\u2026) To explain this requirement, Jesus uses two parables: that of the tower to be built and that of the king going to war. (\u2026)\nJesus does not wish to address the topic of war here; it is only a parable. Yet at this moment in which we are praying intensely for peace, this word of the Lord touches us to the core, and essentially tells us: there is a more profound war that we must all fight! It is the firm and courageous decision to renounce evil and its enticements and to choose the good, ready to pay in person: this is following Christ, this is what taking up our cross means! This profound war against evil! What is the use of waging war, so many wars, if you aren't capable of waging this profound war against evil? It is pointless! It doesn\u2019t work.... Among other things this war against evil entails saying \u201cno\u201d to the fratricidal hatred and falsehood that are used. (\u2026) These are the enemies to fight, united and consistent, following no other interests than those of peace and of the common good. (Angelus, 8 September 2013)"

She is not afraid of losing the little she has because she trusts in God\u2019s abundance, and God\u2019s abundance multiplies the joy of those who give. (\u2026) This is why Jesus proposes her as a teacher of faith, this woman: she does not go to the Temple to clear her conscience, she does not pray to make herself seen, she does not show off her faith, but she gives from her heart generously and freely. The sound of her few coins is more beautiful than the grandiose offerings of the rich, since they express a life sincerely dedicated to God, a faith that does not live by appearances but by unconditional trust. Let us learn from her: a faith without external frills, but interiorly sincere; a faith composed of humble love for God and for our brothers and sisters. (Angelus, 7 novembre 2021) ",
            "The Gospel presents us with this striking contrast: the rich who give from their surplus wealth to make themselves seen, and a poor woman, who without seeming to, offers every little bit she has. Two symbols of human attitudes. Jesus watches the two scenes. And it is this very verb \u2014 \u201cto watch\u201d \u2014 that sums up his teaching: \u201cwe must watch out for\u201d those who live their faith with duplicity, like the scribes, so as not to become like them; whereas we must \u201cwatch\u201d the widow, and take her as a model. (\u2026) Jesus praises the fact that this widow puts all she has into the treasury. She has nothing left, but finds her everything in God. She is not afraid of losing the little she has because she trusts in God\u2019s abundance, and God\u2019s abundance multiplies the joy of those who give.

            "Be on guard not to scandalize. Scandal is evil because scandal wounds; it wounds the vulnerability of the People of God and it wounds the weakness of the People of God. And very often, these wounds are felt throughout one\u2019s life. Even worse than wounds, scandal can kill: kill hope\u2026kill families, kill many hearts\u2026 (Santa Marta, 13 November 2017)",
            "A mustard seed is tiny, yet Jesus says that faith this size, small but true and sincere, suffices to achieve what is humanly impossible, unthinkable. And it is true! We all know people who are simple, humble, but whose faith is so strong it can move mountains! Let us think, for example, of some mothers and fathers who face very difficult situations; or of some sick, and even gravely ill, people who transmit serenity to those who come to visit them. How many people among us have such strong, humble faith, and what good they do! (Angelus, 6 October 2013)",
            "Scandal is bad because it causes wounds, it hurts the vulnerability of the People of God and wounds the weakness of the People of God, and many times these wounds are carried throughout life. (...) How many Christians, with their example, drive people away with their incoherence, with their own incoherence: the incoherence of Christians is one of the easiest weapons that the devil has to weaken the People of God and to drive them away from the Lord. To say one thing and do another. (Homily, Santa Marta, 13 November 2017)",
            "The faith comparable to the grain of mustard is a faith that is not proud and self-assured (\u2026).  It is a faith that, in its humility, feels a great need of God and in its smallness surrenders itself, trusting fully in Him. It is a faith that gives us the ability to look with hope at the alternate events of life, which helps us to accept even defeat, suffering, with the awareness that evil never has, never will have, the last word. (Angelus, 6 October 2019)",
            "When there is no Christian coherency, and you live with this incoherence, you\u2019re giving scandal. If you happen to be with an atheist who tells you that he does not believe in God, you can read him the whole library, where it says that God exists, and where it is proven that God exists, and he will not believe. However, if in the presence of this same atheist you witness to a consistent, Christian life, something will begin to work in his heart. And it will be your witness that brings him the restlessness on which the Holy Spirit works. All of us, the whole Church should ask the Lord for the grace to be consistent. Acknowledging ourselves as sinners, weak and inconsistent, but always ready to ask for the Lord\u2019s forgiveness. All of us, in fact, are able to ask for forgiveness, and God never tires of forgiving. It is important, then, to have the humility to ask for forgiveness when we have not been consistent. In the end, it is a matter of proceeding forward in life with Christian consistency by testifying that we believe in Jesus Christ and by acknowledging that we are sinners. But with the courage to ask for forgiveness when we make mistakes and with great fear of giving scandal. May the Lord give all of us this grace. (Santa Marta, 27 February 2014)",
            "\u201cIf any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea\u201d (Mk 9:42). With these words, directed to the disciples, Jesus warns of the danger of scandal, that is, of hindering the path and hurting the lives of the \u201clittle ones\u201d. It is a stern warning that calls us to pause and reflect. (\u2026) If we want to sow seeds for the future, also regarding social and economic issues, it would be helpful for us to put the Gospel of mercy at the foundation of our choices. Jesus is mercy. All of us are beneficiaries of his mercy. Otherwise, the monuments of our opulence, however seemingly imposing, will be no more than giants with feet of clay (cf. Dn 2:31-45). Let us not deceive ourselves: without love, nothing lasts. Everything disappears and falls apart, and we are left as prisoners of a fleeting, empty and meaningless life in a hypocritical world. It is devoid of all credibility despite its fa\u00e7ades. Why? Because it has scandalized the little ones. (Homily, King Baudouin Stadium of Brussells, 29 September 2024)"

This virtue of hope that is so hard to live. The smallest but strongest of the virtues.\nAnd our hope has a face: the face of the Risen Lord, who comes \u201cwith great power and glory\u201d (v. 26), which will manifest his love, crucified and transfigured in the Resurrection.\n ",
            "Human history, like the personal history of each of us, cannot be understood as a simple succession of meaningless words and facts. Nor can it be interpreted in the light of a fatalistic vision, as if all were already preordained according to a fate that removes any space for freedom, preventing us from making choices as the fruit of true decision. In today\u2019s Gospel passage, however, Jesus says that the history of peoples and that of individuals have a purpose and an aim to fulfil: the definitive encounter with the Lord. (Angelus, 18 November 2018)",
            "And we, brothers and sisters, let us ask ourselves: on what are we investing our lives? On things that pass, such as money, success, appearance, physical well-being? We will take away none of these things. Are we attached to earthly things, as if we were to live here forever? When we are young and healthy, everything is fine, but when the time comes to depart, we have to leave everything behind. The Word of God warns us today: this world will pass away. And only love will remain. To base one\u2019s life on the Word of God, therefore, is not an escape from history, but an immersion into earthly realities in order to make them solid, to transform them with love, imprinting on them the sign of eternity, the sign of God. Here then is some advice for making important choices. When I do not know what to do, how to make a definitive choice, an important decision, a decision that involves Jesus\u2019 love, what must I do? Before deciding, let us imagine that we are standing in front of Jesus, as at the end of life, before he who is love. And imagining ourselves there, in his presence, at the threshold of eternity, we make the decision for today. We must decide in this way: always looking to eternity, looking at Jesus. It may not be the easiest, it may not be the most immediate, but it will be the right one that is certain. (Angelus 14 November 2021)"

All the Gentiles accepted the command of the king. Many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath. Apostasy.

            "Let us think about the story of Bartimaeus, a character in the Gospel.  And I confess that for me he is the most likeable of all. Greater than any discussion to the contrary, there is a voice in mankind\u2019s heart that invokes. We all have this voice within. A voice that comes forth spontaneously without anyone commanding it, a voice that asks itself about the meaning of our journey on earth, especially when we find ourselves in darkness: \u201cJesus, have mercy on me! Jesus have mercy on me!\u201d. This is a beautiful prayer. (General audience, 6 May 2020)",
            "Bartimaeus\u2019 faith is evident from his prayer. It is not a timid and standard prayer. First and foremost, he calls the Lord \u201cSon of David\u201d: that is, he acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah, the King who would come into the world. Then he calls Him by name, confidently; \u201cJesus\u201d. He is not afraid of Him, he does not stay at a distance. (\u2026) He says what is essential and entrusts himself to God\u2019s love which can make his life flourish again by doing what is humanly impossible. This is why he does not ask the Lord for alms, but makes everything be seen \u2014 his blindness and his suffering which was far more than not being able to see. His blindness was the tip of the iceberg ; but there must have been wounds, humiliations, broken dreams, mistakes, remorse in his heart. He prayed with his heart. And what about us? When we ask for God\u2019s grace, do we also include in our prayer our own history, our wounds, our humiliations, our broken dreams, our mistakes and our regrets?\n\u201cJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.\u201d Let us, too, recite this prayer today. Let us repeat it and ask ourselves: \u201cWhat is my prayer like\u201d? Let each of us ask ourselves: \u201cWhat is my prayer like\u201d? Is it courageous, does it contain the good insistence of Bartimaeus, does it know how to \u201ctake hold\u201d of the Lord as he passes, or is it rather content with making a formal greeting every now and then, when I remember? Those lukewarm prayers that do not help at all. Furthermore, is my prayer \u201csubstantial\u201d, does it bare my heart before the Lord? Do I take my story and life experience to him? Or is it anaemic, superficial, made up of rituals, without feeling and without heart? When faith is alive, prayer is heartfelt: it does not beg for spare change, it is not reduced to the needs of the moment. We must ask everything of Jesus, who can do everything. Do not forget this. We must ask everything of Jesus, with my insistence before Him. He cannot wait to pour out his grace and joy into our hearts; but unfortunately, it is we who keep our distance, through timidness, laziness or unbelief. (Angelus, 24 October 2021)",
            "The blind in those times \u2014 but also not so long ago \u2014 were able to live only by alms. The figure of this blind man represents the many people who, today too, are marginalized because of a disability, be it physical or of another kind. He is separated from the flock, sitting there while people pass by: busy, lost in their thoughts and in so many things.... And the road, which could be a place of encounter, for him is instead a place of solitude. Crowds pass by ... and he is alone. (\u2026) The evangelist says that someone in the crowd explained to the blind man the reason why all those people had gathered, saying: \u201cJesus of Nazareth is passing by!\u201d (v. 37). Jesus\u2019 passing by is indicated with the same verb with which the Book of Exodus speaks of the passing of the Angel of Death, who saves the Israelites in the land of Egypt (cf. Exodus 12:23). It is the \u201cpassage\u201d of Easter, the beginning of the liberation: when Jesus passes by there is always liberation, there is always salvation! (\u2026) Brothers and sisters, the Lord\u2019s passing by is an encounter of mercy that unites everything around him to enable us to recognize one who is in need of help and of consolation. Jesus also passes by in your Life; and when Jesus passes by, and I realize it, it is an invitation to draw near to him, to be better, to be a better Christian, to follow Jesus.

And in this plan there is also the salvation of Zacchaeus, a dishonest man who is despised by all, and therefore in need of conversion.And when he enters Zacchaeus\u2019 house he says: \u201cToday, salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost\u201d (vv. 9-10). Jesus\u2019 gaze goes beyond sins and prejudices. We must learn this.he sees the person through the eyes of God, who does not stop at past faults, but sees the future good.Sometimes we try to correct or convert a sinner by scolding him, by pointing out his mistakes and wrongful behaviour. Jesus\u2019 attitude toward Zacchaeus shows us another way: that of showing those who err their value, the value that God continues to see in spite of everything, despite all their mistakes. This may bring about a positive surprise, which softens the heart and spurs the person to bring out the good that he has within himself. This is how God acts with all of us: he is not blocked by our sin, but overcomes it with love and makes us feel nostalgia for the good. (Angelus, 30 october 2016)",

            "We too would have been scandalized by this behaviour of Jesus. But contempt for and rejection of the sinner only isolate him and cause him to harden in the evil he commits against himself and the community. Instead, God condemns sin, but tries to save the sinner; He goes looking for him to bring him back on the right path. Those who have never felt they are sought by God\u2019s mercy find it difficult to grasp the extraordinary greatness of the gestures and words with which Jesus approaches Zacchaeus. (Angelus, 3 November 2019)",
            "The first glance is not from Zacchaeus, but from Jesus, who among the many faces that surrounded Him \u2013 the crowd \u2013 seeks precisely that one. The merciful gaze of the Lord reaches us before we ourselves realize that we need it in order to be saved. And with this gaze of the divine Master there begins the miracle of the conversion of the sinner. Indeed, Jesus calls to him, and He calls him by his name: \u201cZacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today\u201d. (Angelus 3 November 2019)",
            "Today\u2019s Gospel reading (\u2026) shows us two types of misunderstanding that Jesus had to face: that of the scribes and that of his own brethren. They were worried, because his new itinerant life seemed folly to them. In fact, he exhibited such openness toward the people, especially toward the sick and toward sinners, to the extent that he did not even have time to eat. Jesus was like that: people first; serving people; helping people; teaching people; healing people. He was for the people. He did not even have time to eat. Thus, his brethren decided to take him back home to Nazareth. His brethren came to the place where Jesus was teaching and they sent to him and called him. He was told: \u201c\u2018Your mother and your brethren are outside, asking for you.\u2019 And he replied: \u2018Who are my mother and my brethren?\u2019. And looking around on those who sat about him, he said \u2018Here are my mother and my brethren! Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother\u2019\u201d. Jesus formed a new family, no longer based on natural ties, but on faith in him, on his love which welcomes us and unites us to each other, in the Holy Spirit. All those who welcome Jesus\u2019 word are children of God and brothers and sisters among themselves. Welcoming the word of Jesus makes us brothers and sisters, makes us Jesus\u2019 family. Speaking ill of others, destroying others\u2019 reputations, makes us the devil\u2019s family.\nJesus\u2019 response was not a lack of respect for his mother and his brethren. Rather, for Mary it is the greatest recognition, precisely because she herself is the perfect disciple who completely obeyed God\u2019s will. May the Virgin Mother help us to live always in communion with Jesus, recognizing the work of the Holy Spirit who acts in him and in the Church, regenerating the world to new life. (Angelus, 10 June 2018)",
            "Brothers, sisters, let us remember this: the gaze of God never stops at our past, full of errors, but looks with infinite confidence at what we can become. And if at times we feel we are people who are \u201csmall of stature\u201d, not up to the challenges of life and far less of the Gospel, mired in problems and sins, Jesus always looks at us with love. As with Zacchaeus, he comes towards us, he calls us by name and, if we welcome him, he comes to our home. Then we might ask ourselves: how do we look at ourselves? Do we feel inadequate, and resign ourselves, or precisely there, when we feel down, do we seek the encounter with Jesus? And then: what gaze do we have towards those who have erred, and who struggle to get up again from the dust of their mistakes? Is it a gaze from above, that judges, disdains, that excludes? Let us remember that it is legitimate to look down on someone only to help them get up again: nothing more. Only then is it legitimate to look down from above. But we Christians must have the gaze of Christ, who embraces from below, who seeks those who are lost, with compassion. This is, and must be, the gaze of the Church, always, the gaze of Christ, not the condemning gaze. Let us pray to Mary, whose humility the Lord looked upon, and ask her for the gift of a new outlook on ourselves and on others. (Angelus, 30 October 2022)"

On the contrary, fear paralyzes us; it causes our self-destruction. We are called to reflect in order to discover what our idea of God really is.

Before setting off on a journey, a man gives his servants talents, which at that time were coins of considerable value: he gives five talents to one servant, two to another, one to another, to each according to his ability. The servant who had received five talents was resourceful and he traded with them, earning another five. The servant who had received two behaved likewise, and acquired another two. However, the servant who had received one dug a hole in the ground and therein hid his master\u2019s coin. (\u2026) This servant did not have a trusting relationship with his master, but was afraid of him, and this hindered him. Fear always immobilizes and often leads to making bad choices. Fear discourages us from taking the initiative; it induces us to take refuge in secure and guaranteed solutions, and thus end up not accomplishing anything good.

            "And so, we can dwell a little on this word: family. Because it is a reality that has changed a great deal, and is changing, yet the family remains a key value. But do you know when the true \u201crevolution\u201d of the family took place? Do you know who did it? It is easy to answer, because true newness has been brought to this world by one only: Jesus Christ. The true revolution of the family was done by him. And he also renewed, transformed, the family. In what sense? We are told by an episode of the Gospel, where there is one of those words of Jesus that leave us disconcerted, that throw us into crisis. The three synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke tell it. Jesus is preaching in the midst of his disciples and other people, and at a certain point they say to him that his mother and his brethren are outside. Do you remember how Jesus answers? He turns to those around him and says: \u201cHere are my mother and my brethren!\u201d, adding, \u201cFor whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother\u201d (cf. Mt 12:46-50; Mk 3:31-35; Lk 8:19-21). This word of Jesus, if we think about it carefully, generates a new way of understanding the family.\nDo you see? At the beginning I addressed you by calling you \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d. It is not merely a formula, a conventional turn of phrase. No. It is a reality, a new reality generated by Jesus Christ. And as I was saying, this word of Jesus radically renewed the family, so that the strongest, most important bond for us Christians is no longer that of blood, but of the love of Christ. His love transforms the family, freeing it from the dynamics of selfishness, which derive from the human condition and from sin; he frees it and enriches it with a new bond, even stronger but free, not dominated by the interests and conventions of kinship, but animated by gratitude, recognition, and reciprocal service.

(\u2026) These words help us to reject the danger of also making our soul, which is God\u2019s dwelling place, a house of trade, by living in constant search of our personal interests instead of generous and supportive love. This teaching of Jesus is always timely, not only for Church communities, but also for individuals, for civil communities and for society as a whole. Indeed, it is a common temptation to exploit good, sometimes dutiful deeds in order to cultivate private, if not entirely illicit interests. It is a grave danger, especially when one exploits God himself and the worship owed to him, or service to mankind, His image. This is why Jesus used \u201ca harsh approach\u201d that time, in order to shake us from this mortal danger. (Angelus, 4 March 2018)",

It is of great comfort and hope to listen to this simple and clear word of Jesus about life beyond death; we need it very much especially in our time, so rich in knowledge about the universe but so lacking in wisdom about eternal life.\nJesus\u2019 clear certainty about resurrection is based entirely on the fidelity of God, Who is the God of life.

This is a doubt that touches mankind of every age and also us: after this earthly pilgrimage, what will become of our life? Will it belong to nothing, to death?\nJesus responds that life belongs to God, who loves us and cares very deeply about us, to the point of linking His name to ours: He is \u201cthe God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Now He is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him\u201d (vv. 37-38).

The conclusion of history will be his eternal kingdom. Today\u2019s Gospel passage (cf.

Generosity in little things. Maybe we don\u2019t do it because we just don\u2019t think about it. The Gospel message makes us reflect: How can I be more generous? (\u2026) But nowadays there is another disease, which works against generosity: The disease of consumerism.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible disease nowadays, consumerism. (\u2026) excessive spending to buy more than we need \u2013 is a lack of austerity in life. This is the enemy of generosity. And material generosity \u2013 thinking about the poor: \u2018I can give this so that they can eat or have clothes\u2019 \u2013 has an ulterior result: It enlarges the heart and helps us be magnanimous.\u201d (Santa Marta, 26 November 2018)",
            "In a certain sense the Church is \u201ca widow somewhat, because she is waiting for her Bridegroom to return...\u201d. Of course, \u201cshe has her Spouse in the Eucharist, in the Word of God, in the poor: but she is waiting for Him to return\u201d. What of \u201cthe figure of the Church can be seen in this woman\u201d? She wasn\u2019t important, her name didn\u2019t appear in the newspapers, no one knew her. She had no degree... nothing. Nothing. She did not shine of her own light. Likewise, the great virtue of the Church is not shining of her own light, but rather reflecting the light that comes from her Spouse. Especially since over the centuries, when the Church wanted to have her own light, she was wrong. (\u2026) The Church receives light from there, from the Lord, and all the services we do in the Church help her to receive that light. When a service is lacking this light, it\u2019s not good because it causes the Church to become rich, or powerful, or to seek power, or to lose her way, as has happened so many times in history and, as it happens in our life when we want to have another light: our own light, which is not really that of the Lord. (\u2026)\nWhen the Church is humble and poor, and even when the Church confesses her misfortunes \u2014 we all have them \u2014 the Church is faithful. It\u2019s as if the Church were saying: I am darkened, but light comes to me from there! and this does us so much good. Thus, let us pray to this widow who is surely in heaven that she may teach us to be like the Church, renouncing all we have and keeping nothing for ourselves but instead giving all for the Lord and for our neighbour. Always humble and without boasting of having our own light, but always seeking the light which comes from the Lord. (Santa Maria, 24 November 2014)"

During Advent we do not just live in anticipation of Christmas; we are also called to rekindle the anticipation of the glorious return of Christ \u2014 when he will return at the end of time \u2014 preparing ourselves, with consistent and courageous choices, for the final encounter with him. During these four weeks we are called to leave behind a resigned and routine way of life and to go forth, nourishing hope, nourishing dreams for a new future.\nInner listlessness comes from always turning around ourselves and being blocked by our own life, with its problems, its joy, and suffering, but always turning around ourselves. Advent invites us to a commitment to vigilance, looking beyond ourselves, expanding our mind and heart in order to open ourselves up to the needs of people, of brothers and sisters, and to the desire for a new world. It is the desire of many people tormented by hunger, by injustice and by war. It is the desire of the poor, the weak, the abandoned. This is a favourable time to open our hearts, to ask ourselves concrete questions about how and for whom we expend our lives. (Angelus, 2 December 2018)"

The storm comes \u2013 and we all have storms in our lives, all of us \u2013 and we are unable to stand firm. Many say: \u2018No, I\u2019ll change my life.\u2019 They think making life changes is like putting on makeup. Changing my life requires changing the foundations of my life, that is, finding the Rock that is Christ. \u2018I would like to renovate this building because it\u2019s extremely ugly, so I would like to make it a little more beautiful and strengthen the foundation.\u2019 But if all I do is put on makeup, then things won\u2019t go far; it will fall. Christian life falls when based on appearances. (\u2026) We cannot build our lives on passing things, on appearances, on acting like everything is going fine. We go to the rock, where our salvation awaits. And there we will all \u2013 each one of us \u2013 be happy. (Santa Marta, 5 December 2019)"

Do I take \u201ca more reliable path or do I seek refuge under the roof of rules and of many manmade commandments?

For this reason, turning toward the whole crowd there, He declares that one who wishes to become his disciple must accept being a servant, as He has made himself a servant, and cautions: \u201cIf any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me\u201d.\nTo undertake the discipleship of Jesus means to take up your cross \u2014 we all have one \u2014 to accompany him on his path, an uncomfortable path that is not of success or of fleeting glory, but one which takes us to true freedom, to that which frees us from selfishness and sin. It is necessary to clearly reject that worldly mentality which places one\u2019s \u201cI\u201d and one\u2019s own interests at the centre of existence. That is not what Jesus wants from us! Instead Jesus invites us to lose our life for him and for the Gospel, to receive it renewed, fulfilled and authentic. (Angelus, 13 September 2015)"

After the angel\u2019s annunciation, a difficult period loomed ahead for the Virgin: her unexpected pregnancy exposed her to misunderstandings and even severe punishment, including stoning, in the culture of that time. Let us imagine how many concerns and worries she had! Nevertheless, she did not become discouraged, she was not disheartened: but she arose. She did not look down at her problems, but up to God. And she did not think about who to ask for help, but to whom to bring help. She always thought about others: that is Mary, always thinking of the needs of others.

To arise, so as not to get bogged down in problems, sinking into self-pity or falling into a sadness that paralyses us. But why get up? Because God is great and is ready to lift us up again if we reach out to him. So let us cast to him the negative thoughts, the fears that block every impulse and that prevent us from moving forward. And then let us do as Mary did: let us look around and look for someone to whom we can be of help! (Angelus, 19 December 2021)"

The great things God has done with humble people, the great things the Lord does in the world with the humble, because humility is like a vacuum that leaves room for God. The humble are powerful because they are humble: not because they are strong. And this is the greatness of the humble and of humility. (Angelus, 15 August 2017)",
            "What does our Mother advise us? Today in the Gospel the first thing she says is: \u201cMy soul magnifies the Lord\u201d (Lk 1:46). Accustomed to hearing these words, perhaps we no longer pay attention to their meaning. To \u201cmagnify\u201d literally means \u201cto make great\u201d, to enlarge. Mary \u201caggrandises the Lord\u201d: not problems, which she did not lack at the time, but the Lord. How often, instead, we let ourselves be overwhelmed by difficulties and absorbed by fears! Our Lady does not, because she puts God as the first greatness of life. From here the Magnificat springs forth, from here joy is born: not from the absence of problems, which come sooner or later, but joy is born from the presence of God who helps us, who is near us. Because God is great. And, above all, God looks on the lowly ones. We are His weakness of love: God looks on and loves the lowly. (Angelus, 15 August 2020)",
            "When Mary enters the home of her cousin, she praises the Lord. She does not talk about her weariness from the journey, but rather a song of jubilation springs from her heart. Because those who love God know how to praise. And today\u2019s Gospel shows us \u201ca cascade of praise: the child who leaps with joy in Elizabeth\u2019s womb (cf. Lk 1:44); Elizabeth who utters words of blessing and \u201cthe first beatitude\u201d: \u201cBlessed is she who believed\u201d (Lk 1:45); and everything culminates in Mary, who proclaims the Magnificat (cf. Lk 1:46-55). Praise increases joy. Praise is like a ladder: it leads hearts upwards. Praise raises souls and defeats the temptation to give up. Have you seen how boring people, those who live off gossip, are incapable of giving praise? Ask yourselves: am I capable of giving praise? How good it is to praise God every day, and others too! How good it is to live in gratitude and blessing instead of regrets and complaints, to lift up our gaze instead of having a long face! Complaints: there are people who complain every day. But see that God is near you, see that he has created you, see the things he has given you. Praise, praise! And this is spiritual health. (Angelus, 15 August 2023)"

God visits His people in the midst of his people, and draws near to them. Proximity. This is how God works. Then there is an expression that is often repeated in the Bible: 'The Lord was moved with great compassion'. Closeness and compassion: this is how the Lord visits His people. And when we want to proclaim the Gospel, to bring forth the word of Jesus, this is the path. The other path is that of the teachers, the preachers of the time. But they were distant. And this was not a visit of the Lord. The people did not feel this to be a grace, because it lacked that closeness, it lacked compassion, it lacked that essence of suffering with the people. When God visits His people he restores hope to them. Always. You can preach the Word of God brilliantly: there have been many excellent preachers throughout history. But if these preachers have failed to sow hope, that sermon is useless. It is mere vanity. (Santa Marta, 16 September 2014)",

We must learn to trust and be silent before the mystery of God and to contemplate, with humility and silence, his work which is revealed in history and often exceeds our imagination. And now that the event comes to pass, now that Elizabeth and Zechariah experience that \u201cwith God nothing will be impossible\u201d (Lk 1:37), their joy is great.

The patience of God. The \u201csign\u201d is in fact the humility of God, the humility of God taken to the extreme; it is the love with which, that night, he assumed our frailty, our suffering, our anxieties, our desires and our limitations. The message that everyone was expecting, that everyone was searching for in the depths of their souls, was none other than the tenderness of God: God who looks upon us with eyes full of love, who accepts our poverty, God who is in love with our smallness. Life must be met with goodness, with meekness. When we realize that God is in love with our smallness, that he made himself small in order to better encounter us, we cannot help but open our hearts to him, and beseech him: \u201cLord, help me to be like you, give me the grace of tenderness in the most difficult circumstances of life, give me the grace of closeness in the face of every need, of meekness in every conflict\u201d.

With these words, the shepherds set out. We too, Lord, want to go up to Bethlehem. Today too, the road is uphill: the heights of our selfishness need to be surmounted, and we must not lose our footing or slide into worldliness and consumerism. I want to come to Bethlehem, Lord, because there you await me. I want to realize that you, lying in a manger, are the bread of my life. I need the tender fragrance of your love so that I, in turn, can be bread broken for the world. Take me upon your shoulders, Good Shepherd; loved by you, I will be able to love my brothers and sisters and to take them by the hand.

No, he uses the word flesh because it indicates our human condition in all its weakness, in all its frailty. He tells us that God became fragile so he could touch our fragility up close. Thus, from the moment the Lord became flesh, nothing about our life is extraneous to him. There is nothing that he scorns, we can share everything with him, everything. Dear brother, dear sister, God became flesh to tell us, to tell you that he loves you right there, that he loves us right  there, in our frailties, in your frailties; right there, where we are most ashamed, where you are most ashamed. This is bold, God\u2019s decision is bold: He became flesh precisely where very often we are ashamed; He enters into our shame, to become our brother, to share the path of life.

And he will never be separated from it: now and forever he is in heaven with his body made of human flesh. He has united himself forever to our humanity; we might say that he \u201cespoused\u201d himself to it. I like to think that when the Lord prays to the Father for us, he does not merely speak: he shows him the wounds of the flesh, he shows him the wounds he suffered for us. This is Jesus: with his flesh he is the intercessor, he wanted to bear even the signs of suffering. Jesus, with his flesh, is before the Father. Indeed, the Gospel says that He came to dwell among us. He did not come to visit us, and then leave; He came to dwell with us, to stay with us. (Angelus, 3 January 2021)",

The Lord comes to the world in a stable and is laid in a manger for animals, since his parents could find no room in the inn, even though the time had come for Mary to give birth. He comes among us in silence and in the dark of night, because the word of God needs no spotlights or loud human voices. He is himself the Word that gives life its meaning, he is the Light that brightens our path. \u201cThe true light, which enlightens everyone\u201d \u2013 the Gospel tells us \u2013 \u201cwas coming into the world\u201d (Jn 1:9).\nJesus is born in our midst; he is God with us. He comes to accompany our daily lives, to share with us in all things: our joys and sorrows, our hopes and fears. He comes as a helpless child. He is born in the cold night, poor among the poor. In need of everything, he knocks at the door of our heart to find warmth and shelter.\nLike the shepherds of Bethlehem, surrounded by light, may we set out to see the sign that God has given us. May we overcome our spiritual drowsiness and the shallow holiday glitter that makes us forget the One whose birth we are celebrating. Let us leave behind the hue and din that deadens our hearts and makes us spend more time in preparing decorations and gifts than in contemplating the great event: the Son of God born for us.

Christians are therefore men and women who \u201cgo against the tide\u201d. It is normal: because the world is marked by sin which manifests itself in various forms of selfishness and injustice; those who follow Christ walk in the opposite direction. Not due to an argumentative spirit, but because of loyalty to the rationale of the Kingdom of God, which is a logic of hope that translates into a lifestyle based on the instructions of Jesus. Christians travel their path in this world with the essentials for the journey but with their heart filled with love. The true defeat for him or for her is to fall into the temptation of revenge and violence, responding to evil with evil. Therefore without jaws, without claws, without weapons. The only strength Christians have is the Gospel. Sometimes, reading the stories of so many of yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s martyrs, \u2014 who are more numerous than the martyrs of the early days \u2014 we are amazed at the strength with which they have faced the supreme trial. This strength is a sign of the great hope that animated them: the certain hope that nothing and no one could separate them from God\u2019s love given to us in Jesus Christ (cf. Rom 8:38-39).

In Stephen\u2019s martyrdom, in fact, violence is defeated by love, death by life: at the hour of supreme witness, he contemplates the open heavens and grants forgiveness to his persecutors (cf. Acts 7:60). (Angelus, 26 December 2019)",

Like the moon, which does not have its own light, these witnesses do not have their own light, they are capable of taking Jesus\u2019s light and reflecting it. Stephen was falsely accused and brutally stoned, but in the darkness of hatred (which was the torment of his stoning), he allowed the light of Jesus to shine: he prayed for his murderers and forgave them, like Jesus on the cross. He is the first martyr, that is, the first witness, the first of a host of brothers and sisters who, even until today, continue to bring the light into the darkness \u2013 people who respond to evil with good, who do not succumb to violence and lies, but break the cycle of hatred with meekness and love.

In order to dry the tears from the faces of those who are suffering, it is necessary to join our tears with theirs. Only in this way can our words be really capable of giving a little hope. If I cannot speak words in this way, with tears, with suffering, then silence is better: a caress, a gesture and no words. (General Audience, 4 January 2017)",

Let us pause on this scene and imagine Mary who, as a tender and caring mother, has just laid Jesus in the manger. In that act of laying him down we can see a gift given to us: Our Lady does not just keep her Son to herself, but presents him to us. She does not just hold him in her arms, but puts him down to invite us to look at him, to welcome him and to adore him. This is Mary\u2019s motherhood: she offers the Son who is born to all of us. Always by giving her Son, showing her Son, never treating her Son as something of her own, no. And so throughout Jesus\u2019 life.\nAnd in laying him before our eyes, without saying a word, she gives us a wonderful message: God is near, within our reach. He does not come with the power of one who wants to be feared, but with the frailness of someone who asks to be loved. He does not judge from his throne on high, but looks at us from below, like a brother, rather, like a son. He is born little and in need so that no one would ever again be ashamed of themselves. It is precisely when we experience our weakness and our frailness that we can feel God even nearer, because he appeared to us in this way \u2014 weak and frail. He is the God-child who is born so as not to exclude anyone, in order to make us all become brothers and sisters. (Angelus, 1 January 2022)"

(\u2026) living well does not mean filling oneself with useless things, but being freed from the superfluous, to dig deeply within ourselves so as to hold on to what is truly important before God. Only if, through silence and prayer, we make space for Jesus, who is the Word of the Father, will we know how to free ourselves from the pollution of vain words and gossip. Silence and sobriety \u2014 in words, in the use of things, in the media and social media \u2014 these are not just fioretti [translator\u2019s note: a common practice in Italian devotional life in which someone offers a small sacrifice, a resolution, or the proposal to do a good deed to Our Lord or Our Lady] or virtues; they are essential elements of the Christian life.\nAnd we come to the second image, the voice. This is the means by which we manifest what we think and what we bear in our hearts. We understand, therefore, that it is quite connected with silence, because it expresses what matures inside, from listening to what the Spirit suggests. Brothers and sisters, if one does not know how to be quiet, it is unlikely that one will have something good to say; while, the more attentive the silence, the stronger the word. In John the Baptist that voice is linked to the genuineness of his experience and the purity of his heart. (Angelus, 10 December 2023)"

            "We are on the bank of the River Jordan. John is baptizing; there are many people, men and women of various ages, who have come there, to the river, to receive baptism from the hands of the man who reminded many of Elijah, the great Prophet who nine centuries before had purified the Israelites of idolatry and led them back to the true faith in the God of the Covenant, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. John preaches that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, that the Messiah is about to reveal himself, and one must prepare, convert and act with righteousness; and he begins to baptize in the River Jordan in order to give the people a tangible means of repentance. (\u2026)  And thus, the moment arrives: Jesus appears on the river bank, in the midst of the people, the sinners \u2014 like all of us.

Jesus is the Messiah. John is disconcerted, because He manifests himself in an unimaginable way: in the midst of sinners, baptized with them, or rather, for them. But the Spirit enlightens John and helps him understand that in this way God\u2019s justice is fulfilled, his plan of salvation is fulfilled: Jesus is the Messiah, the King of Israel, however, not with the power of this world but as the Lamb of God, who takes upon himself and takes away the sins of the world.

It is John the Baptist himself who points out the Messiah to the two of them with these words: \u201cBehold, the Lamb of God!\u201d (v. 36). And those two, trusting the Baptist\u2019s testimony, follow Jesus. He realizes this and asks: \u201cWhat do you seek?\u201d, and they ask Him: \u201cRabbi, where are you staying?\u201d (v. 38).\nJesus does not respond: \u201cI live in Capernaum, or in Nazareth\u201d, but says: \u201cCome and see\u201d (v. 39). Not a calling card, but an invitation to an encounter. The two follow him and remain with him that afternoon. It is not difficult to imagine them seated, asking him questions and above all listening to him, feeling their hearts inflamed ever more while the Teacher speaks. They sense the beauty of the words that respond to their greatest hope. And all of a sudden they discover that, as evening was drawing around them, the light that God alone can give was exploding within their hearts. One thing catches our attention: 60 years later, or perhaps more, one of them would write in his Gospel: \u201cit was about four in the afternoon\u201d (cf. Jn 1:39) \u2014 he wrote the time. And this is one thing that makes us think: every authentic encounter with Jesus remains alive in memory; it is never forgotten. You forget many encounters, but a true encounter with Jesus remains forever. (\u2026) Then, when they leave from that encounter and return to their brothers, that joy, that light overflows from their hearts like a raging river. One of the two, Andrew, says to his brother, Simon \u2014 whom Jesus will call Peter when He meets him \u2014 \u201cWe have found the Messiah\u201d (v. 41).

In the synagogue at Capernaum he delivers a man from the devil, freeing him from the false image of God that Satan has been suggesting since the beginning: that of a God who does not want our happiness. The possessed man in that passage of the Gospel knows that Jesus is God, but this does not lead him to believe in Him. In fact, he says, \u201cHave you come to destroy us\u201d (v. 24). Many people, even Christians, think the same thing: that is, that Jesus may well be the Son of God, but they doubt that he wants our happiness; indeed, some fear that taking his proposal seriously, the one Jesus proposes to us, means ruining our lives, mortifying our desires, our strongest aspirations. These thoughts sometimes creep up inside us: that God asks too much of us, we fear that God asks too much of us, that he doesn\u2019t really love us. Instead, in our first encounter we saw that the sign of the encounter with the Lord is joy. When I encounter the Lord in prayer, I become joyful. Each one of us becomes joyful, a beautiful thing. Sadness, or fear, on the other hand, are signs of distance from God. (General Audience, 28 Sept 2022)",

Jesus has full authority. His doctrine is new and the Gospel says that the people commented: \u201ca new teaching! With authority\u201d (v. 27).\nAt the same time, Jesus reveals himself to be powerful also in deeds. In the Synagogue of Capernaum, there is a man who is possessed by an unclean spirit which manifests itself by shouting these words: \u201cWhat have you to do with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God\u201d (24). The devil tells the truth: Jesus came to destroy the devil, to ruin the demon, to defeat him. This unclean spirit knows the power of God and he also proclaims his holiness. Jesus rebukes him saying: \u201cBe silent, and come out of him!\u201d (v. 25). These few words from Jesus are enough to obtain victory over Satan, who comes out of that man \u201cconvulsing him and crying out in a loud voice\u201d, the Gospel says (v. 26).\nThis makes a strong impression on those present. Everyone is overcome by fear and asks themselves: \u201cWhat is this? [...] he commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him\u201d. (v. 27).

He is blaspheming.\nWho but God alone can forgive sins?\"\nJesus immediately knew in his mind what\nthey were thinking to themselves,\nso he said, \"Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?\nWhich is easier, to say to the paralytic,\n'Your sins are forgiven,'\nor to say, 'Rise, pick up your mat and walk'?\nBut that you may know\nthat the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth\"\n\u2013he said to the paralytic,\n\"I say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go home.\"\nHe rose, picked up his mat at once,\nand went away in the sight of everyone.\nThey were all astounded\nand glorified God, saying, \"We have never seen anything like this.\"",

            "We who are accustomed to experiencing the forgiveness of sins, perhaps at too \u201clow\u201d a \u201ccost\u201d, must at times remind ourselves of how high a price God\u2019s love for us has cost. Each of us has cost a great deal: Jesus\u2019 life! He would have offered it even for just one of us. Jesus does not go to the Cross because he heals the sick, because he preaches charity, because he proclaims the beatitudes. The Son of God goes to the cross above all because he forgives sins, because he wants the total, definitive liberation of man\u2019s heart. (General Audience, 9 August 2017)",
            "Today the Lord says to each of us: 'Get up, take your life as it is, beautiful, ugly as it is, take it and go on. Don't be afraid, go on with your stretcher' - 'But Lord, this is not the last model...'. But go on! With that ugly stretcher, maybe, but go on! It's your life, it's your joy. \"Do you want to get well?\", the first question the Lord asks us today? \"Yes, Lord\" - \"Get up\". And if we tell the Lord 'Yes, I want to get well. Yes, Lord, help me that I want to get up', we will know what the joy of salvation is like. (Santa Marta, 28 March 2017)",
            "Praise is the proof that I believe that Jesus Christ is God in my life, that He was sent to me to \u201dforgive me\" \u2013 if I have the ability to praise God. To praise the Lord. It is free - praise is gratis. It is a sentiment the Holy Spirit gives and it leads you to say: \u201dYou are the One God.\u201d (Santa Marta 15 January 2016)",
            "These men took a risk when they made the hole in the roof: they risked that the master of the house would sue them, take them to court and make them pay. Following Jesus because we need something, and also taking personal risks, means following Jesus with faith: this is faith. (Santa Marta, 13 January 2017)",
            "Physical health is a gift that we must guard. But the Lord teaches us that we must also guard the health of the heart, spiritual health. There is a word here from Jesus that will perhaps help us: \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\" Are we used to thinking about this medicine of forgiveness of our sins, of our mistakes? We ask ourselves: \"Do I have to ask God's forgiveness for something?\" Yes, yes, in general, we are all sinners. And so it becomes watered down and loses its strength, this power of prophecy that Jesus has when He gets down to the essentials. And today Jesus says, to each one of us, \"I want to forgive you your sins.\" It is a simple thing that Jesus teaches us when He gets down to the essentials. The essential is the health of everything: of body and soul. We guard well the health of the body, but also that of the soul. And we go to that Physician who can heal us, who can forgive sins. Jesus came for this, He gave His life for this. (Santa Marta, 17 January 2020)",
            "\u201cWhen Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \u2018Child, your sins are forgiven\u2019 \u201d (v. 5). And then, as a visible sign, He adds: \u201cRise, pick up your mat, and go home\u201d (v. 11). What a wonderful example of healing! Christ\u2019s action is a direct response to the faith of those people, to the hope they put in Him, to the love they show that they have for each other. And so, Jesus heals, but He does not simply heal the paralysis. Jesus heals everyone, He forgives sins, He renews the life of the paralyzed man and his friend. He makes him born again, let\u2019s say it that way. It is a physical and spiritual healing, all together, the fruit of personal and social contact. Let\u2019s imagine how this friendship, and the faith of all those present in that house, would have grown thanks to Jesus\u2019s action, that healing encounter with Jesus!  And so we can ask ourselves: today, in what way can we help heal our world? As disciples of the Lord Jesus, who is the physician of our souls and bodies, we are called to continue \u201cHis work, work of healing and salvation\u201d (CCC, 1421) in a physical, social and spiritual sense.

Today too Our Lady says to us all: \u201cWhatever he tells you \u2014 Jesus tells you, do it\u201d. To serve the Lord means to listen and to put into practice his Word.

            "Miracles, thus, are extraordinary signs that accompany the Good News and have the purpose of causing or strengthening faith in Jesus. In the miracle performed at Cana, we are able to glimpse an act of benevolence on the part of Jesus toward the bride and groom, a sign of God\u2019s blessing on the marriage. The love between a man and a woman is therefore a good path through which to live the Gospel, that is, to set out with joy on the path of holiness.\nYet the miracle at Cana does not pertain only to spouses. Every human person is called to encounter the Lord in his or her life. Christian faith is a gift which we receive in Baptism and which allows us to encounter God. Faith intersects times of joy and pain, of light and darkness, as in every authentic experience of love. The narrative of the wedding at Cana invites us to rediscover that Jesus does not present himself to us as a judge ready to condemn our faults, nor as a commander who imposes upon us to blindly follow his orders; he is manifest as Saviour of mankind, as brother, as our elder brother, Son of the Father: he presents himself as he who responds to the expectations and promises of joy that dwell in the heart of each one of us.

            "Compassion \u2014 which Jesus feels \u2014 is not simply feeling pity; it\u2019s more! It means to suffer with, in other words to empathize with the suffering of another, to the point of taking it upon oneself. Jesus is like this: he suffers together with us, he suffers with us, he suffers for us. And the sign of this compassion is the healing of countless people he performed\u2026 It isn\u2019t magic, it\u2019s a \u201csign\u201d: a sign that calls for faith in God, provident Father, who does not let us go without \u201cour daily bread\u201d, if we know how to share it as brothers\u2026 The miracle of the loaves foreshadows the Eucharist. It is seen in the gesture of Jesus who, before breaking and distributing the loaves, \u201cblessed\u201d them\u2026 In the Eucharist Jesus does not give just any bread, but the bread of eternal life, he gives Himself, offering Himself to the Father out of love for us. But we must go to the Eucharist with those sentiments of Jesus, which are compassion and the will to share. (Angelus, 3 August 2014)"

(\u2026) What then is the rule for being a Christian with Christ? And what is the \u201csign\u201d that someone is in fact a Christian with Christ? It is simple, whatever leads you to Jesus is valid, and only what comes from Jesus is valid. Jesus is the centre, as he himself says it. Does this bring you to Jesus? Go ahead. Does this commandment, this attitude come from Jesus? Go ahead. But if it doesn't lead you to Jesus, and if it doesn't come from Jesus, then it's a bit dangerous.

            "The heart, when it hardens, is not free and if it isn\u2019t free it\u2019s because it does not love. This concept is expressed in the day\u2019s First Reading. Perfect love casts out fear. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and he who fears is not perfected in love. He isn\u2019t free. He always fears that something painful or sad might happen, which could cause us to go the wrong way in life or to risk eternal salvation. Instead, this is only imagined, simply because that heart doesn\u2019t love. The disciples\u2019 hearts, they were hardened because they still hadn\u2019t learned how to love. It is a closing off which can turn round many things: such as pride, sufficiency, thinking that I\u2019m better than others, or even vanity. There are \u2018mirror\u2019 men and women, who are closed within themselves to watch themselves, constantly; they could be defined as \u201creligious narcissists\u201d. They have hard hearts because they are closed, they aren\u2019t open. And they try to protect themselves with these walls they build around themselves. You can take a thousand courses in catechesis, a thousand courses in spirituality, a thousand courses in yoga, Zen and all these things. But all of this will never be able to give you the freedom of the Son. Only the Holy Spirit moves your heart to say \u2018Father\u2019\u201d; He alone is capable of casting out, of breaking this hardness of the heart and of making it docile to the Lord. Docile to the freedom of love. (Santa Marta, 9 January 2015)",

It is Christ who recreates everything more wonderfully than Creation, this is the reason for our hope. And this hope does not disappoint, because He is faithful. He cannot deny Himself.

            "The Gospel for today\u2019s liturgy shows a few scribes and Pharisees amazed by Jesus\u2019 attitude. (\u2026) Why is Jesus  not concerned with this? Because for him it is important to bring faith back to its centre. We see it repeatedly in the Gospel: this bringing faith back to the centre. And to avoid a risk, which applies to those scribes as well as to us: to observe outward formalities, putting the heart and  faith in the background. Many times we too \u201cput makeup\u201d on our soul. Outward formality and not the heart of faith: this is a risk. It is the risk of a religiosity of appearances : looking good on the outside, while neglecting to purify the heart. There is always the temptation to \u201cdeal with God\u201d with some outward devotion, but Jesus does not settle for this worship. Jesus does not want outward appearances, he wants a faith that touches the heart. (Angelus, 29 August 2021)",

He never passed by, never turned his face away. When a father or mother, or even just friends brought a sick person for him to touch and heal, he never let time be an issue; healing came before the law, even one as sacred as resting on the Sabbath (cf. Mk 3:1-6). The doctors of the law reproached Jesus because he healed on the Sabbath, he did good on the Sabbath. But the love of Jesus was in giving health, doing good: this always takes priority!

He wishes that the search for him and the encounter with him go beyond the immediate satisfaction of material needs. Jesus came to bring us something more, to open our lives to a wider horizon than the daily concerns of eating, clothing ourselves, career and so on. The Lord invites us not to forget that, if it is necessary to worry about bread, it is even more important to nurture our relationship with Him, to strengthen our faith in Him, who is the \u201cbread of life\u201d who came to satisfy our hunger for truth, our hunger for justice and our hunger for love.

            "Our lives are sometimes similar to that of the blind man who opened himself to the light, who opened himself to God, who opened himself to his grace. Today, we are invited to open ourselves to the light of Christ in order to bear fruit in our lives, to eliminate unchristian behaviours; we are all Christians but we all, everyone sometimes has unchristian behaviours, behaviours that are sins. We must repent of this, eliminate these behaviours in order to journey well along the way of holiness, which has its origin in baptism. We, too, have been \u201cenlightened\u201d by Christ in baptism, so that, as St Paul reminds us, we may act as \u201cchildren of light\u201d (Eph 5:8), with humility, patience and mercy. Let us ask ourselves about the state of our own heart? Do I have an open heart or a closed heart? It is opened or closed to God? Open or closed to my neighbour? We are always closed to some degree which comes from original sin, from mistakes, from errors. We need not be afraid! Let us open ourselves to the light of the Lord, he awaits us always in order to enable us to see better, to give us more light, to forgive us. Let us not forget this! (Angelus, 30 March 2014)",
            "While the blind man cried out, calling to Jesus, the people rebuked him to silence him, as if he had no right to speak. They had no compassion for him; his shouting only annoyed them. How often do we feel annoyed when we see many people on the street \u2014 people in need, sick, hungry. How often, when we find ourselves facing the many refugees, do we feel annoyed. It is a temptation we all have. All of us; me too! That is why the Word of God admonishes us, reminding us that indifference and hostility render us blind and deaf, they impede us from seeing our brothers and do not allow us to recognize the Lord in them. When Jesus passes by, and I realize it, it is an invitation to draw near to him, to be better, to be a better Christian, to follow Jesus. (General Audience, 15 June 2016)",

Do you believe that he can change your heart? Do you believe that he can show reality as he sees it, not as we see it? Do you believe that he is light, that he gives us the true light?\u201d. (\u2026) What does it mean to have the true light, to walk in the light? First of all it means abandoning false lights: the cold, vain light of prejudice against others, because prejudice distorts reality and ladens us with aversion to those whom we judge without mercy and condemn without appeal. (\u2026) Another false light, because it is seductive and ambiguous, is that of self-interest: if we value men and things on the basis of usefulness to us, of pleasure, of prestige, we are not truthful in our relationships and situations. (\u2026) And may this new illumination transform us in attitude and action, so that we too, beginning with our poverty, our narrow-mindedness, may be bearers of a ray of the light of Christ.

            "With these two questions, Jesus seems to say that it is one thing to follow the prevailing opinion, and another to encounter him and open oneself to his mystery: there one discovers the truth. Prevailing opinion contains a true but partial response; Peter, and with him the Church of the past, present and always, by the grace of God, responds with the truth: \u201cYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God\u201d. Jesus is the Son of God: hence he is perennially alive as his Father is eternally alive. This is the novelty that grace ignites in the heart of those who are open to the mystery of Jesus: the non-mathematical \u2014 but even stronger, inner \u2014 certainty of having encountered the Wellspring of Life, Life itself made flesh, visible and tangible in our midst. This is the experience of Christians, and it is not their merit, not that of we Christians; it is not our merit, but comes from God; it is a grace of God, the Father and Son and Holy Spirit. All this is contained in the seed of Peter\u2019s response: \u201cYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God\u201d. (Angelus, 29 June 2018)",
            "At the heart of today\u2019s Gospel (Mt 16:13-19) in  today\u2019s liturgy the Lord asks the disciples a decisive question: \u201cWho do you say that I am?\u201d (v. 15). It is the crucial question that Jesus also repeats to us today: \u201cWho am I to you?\u201d. Who am I to you, who have accepted faith but are still afraid to set sail on my Word? Who am I to you, who have been a Christian for  a long time but, worn out by habit, have lost your first love? Who am I to you, who are going through a difficult time and need to rouse yourself in order to begin again? This is what interests the Lord: to be at the centre of our thoughts, to become the reference point of our affections; to be, in short, the love of our lives. Not the opinions we have of him; they do not interest him. He is interested in our love, whether he is in our heart. (Angelus, 29 June 2021)",
            "The Lord wants his disciples of yesterday and today to establish a personal relationship with him, and thus to embrace him at the centre of their life. For this reason he spurs them to face themselves honestly, and he asks: \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d (v. 29). Today, Jesus addresses this very direct and confidential question to each of us: \u201cYou, who do you say that I am? All of you, who do you say that I am? Who am I for you?\u201d. Each person is called to respond, in his or her heart, allowing each one to be illuminated by the light that the Father gives us in order to know his Son Jesus. And it can also happen to us, as it did to Peter, that we passionately affirm: \u201cYou are the Christ\u201d. However, when Jesus tells us clearly what he told the disciples, that is, that his mission is fulfilled not on the wide road to success, but on the arduous path of the suffering, humiliated, rejected and crucified Servant, then it can also happen that we, like Peter, might protest and rebel because this contrasts with our expectations, with worldly expectations. In those moments, we too deserve Jesus\u2019 healthy rebuke: \u201cGet behind me, Satan! For you are not on the side of God, but of men\u201d (v. 33). (Angelus, 16 September 2018)"

We all need to go apart, to ascend the mountain in a space of silence, to find ourselves and better perceive the voice of the Lord. This we do in prayer. But we cannot stay there! Encounter with God in prayer inspires us anew to \u201cdescend the mountain\u201d and return to the plain where we meet many brothers weighed down by fatigue, sickness, injustice, ignorance, poverty both material and spiritual. To these brothers in difficulty, we are called to bear the fruit of that experience with God, by sharing the grace we have received. And this is curious. When we hear the Word of Jesus, when we listen to the Word of Jesus and carry it in our heart, this Word grows. Do you know how it grows? By giving it to the other! The Word of Christ grows in us when we proclaim it, when we give it to others! And this is what Christian life is. It is a mission for the whole Church, for all the baptized, for us all: listen to Jesus and offer him to others. (Angelus, 16 March 2014)",
            "The Transfiguration occurs at a precise moment in Christ\u2019s mission, that is, after he has confided to his disciples that he would have to \u201csuffer many things, [...] be killed, and on the third day be raised\u201d (v. 21). Jesus knows that they do not accept this reality \u2014 the reality of the Cross, the reality of Jesus\u2019 death \u2014, and so he wants to prepare them to withstand the scandal of the passion and death on the Cross, so that they may know that this is the way through which the heavenly Father will lead his Son to glory; by raising him from the dead. And this will also be the way for the disciples: no one can reach eternal life if not by following Jesus, carrying their own cross in their earthly life. Each of us has his or her own cross. The Lord reveals to us the end of this journey which is the Resurrection, beauty: by carrying one\u2019s own cross. (Angelus, 17 March 2019,)",
            "In the Bible, the mountain always has a special significance: it is the elevated place where heaven and earth touch each other, where Moses and the prophets had the extraordinary experience of encountering God. (\u2026) Let us be careful, however: that feeling of Peter that \u201cit is well that we are here\u201d must not become spiritual laziness. We cannot remain on the mountain and enjoy the bliss of this encounter on our own. Jesus himself brings us back to the valley, among our brothers and sisters and into daily life. We must beware of spiritual laziness: we are fine, with our prayers and liturgies, and this is enough for us. No! Going up the mountain does not mean forgetting reality; praying never means avoiding the difficulties of life; the light of faith is not meant to provide beautiful spiritual feelings. No, this is not Jesus\u2019 message. We are called to experience the encounter with Christ so that, enlightened by his light, we might take it and make it shine everywhere. Igniting little lights in people\u2019s hearts; being little lamps of the Gospel that bear a bit of love and hope: this is the mission of a Christian. (Angelus, 28 February 2021)"

            "One should not be ashamed to pray and to say: \u201cLord, I need this\u201d, \u201cLord, I am in difficulty\u201d, \u201cHelp me!\u201d: It is the cry of the heart to God who is the Father. And we have to learn to do so even in happy moments, to thank God for everything that He has given to us, and not to take anything for granted or as if it were owed to us: everything is grace. The Lord always gives to us, always, and everything is grace, everything. The grace of God. However, we must not suffocate the supplication that rises up in us spontaneously. Prayer of petition goes in step with acceptance of our limitations and our nature as creatures. One may even not reach the point of belief in God, but it is difficult not to believe in prayer: it simply exists, it presents itself to us as a cry; and we all know this inner voice that may remain silent for a long time, but one day awakens and cries out. (General Audience, 9 December 2020)",
            "With these words Jesus makes it understood that God always responds, that no prayer will remain unheard; why? Because He is Father, and does not forget his suffering children. Of course, these affirmations disconcert us, because many of our prayers seem not to obtain any results. How often have we asked and not received \u2014 we have all experienced this \u2014 how many times have we knocked and found a closed door? Jesus advises us, in those moments, to persist and to not give up. Prayer always transforms reality, always. If things around us do not change, at least we change; our heart changes. Jesus promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to each man and to each woman who prays. We can be certain that God will respond. The only uncertainty is due to time, but let us not doubt that he will respond. Perhaps we will have to persist for our whole life, but he will respond. He promised us this.

The only uncertainty is due to time, but let us not doubt that he will respond. Perhaps we will have to persist for our whole life, but he will respond.

As you see, they are the same signs that Jesus performed at the Last Supper; and they are also the same gestures that each priest performs when he celebrates the Holy Eucharist. The Christian community is born and reborn continually from this Eucharistic communion. Living communion with Christ is therefore anything but being passive and detached from daily life; on the contrary, it includes us more and more in the relationship with the men and women of our time, in order to offer them the concrete sign of mercy and of the attention of Christ. Jesus wants to reach everyone, in order to bring God\u2019s love to all. (General audience, 17 August 2016)",

May the Lord help us along this path. (Santa Marta, 16 April 2018)",
            "We can understand three messages from this event. The first is compassion. Jesus teaches us to place the needs of the poor before our own. Our needs, even if legitimate, are not as urgent as those of the poor, who lack the basic necessities of life. The second message is sharing. How many times we turn away so as not to see our brothers and sisters in need! And the third message: the miracle of the loaves foreshadows the Eucharist. In the Eucharist Jesus does not give just any bread, but the bread of eternal life, he gives Himself, offering Himself to the Father out of love for us. But we must go to the Eucharist with those sentiments of Jesus, which are compassion and the will to share. (Angelus, 3 August 2014)",
            "Jesus also addresses an invitation to us, an invitation similar to the one probably received by the boy in the Gospel, who has no name and in whom we can all see ourselves: \u201cBe brave, give what little you have, your talents, your possessions, make them available to Jesus and to your brothers and sisters. Do not be afraid, nothing will be lost, because if you share, God will multiply. Banish the false modesty of feeling inadequate, trust yourself. Believe in love, believe in the power of service, believe in the strength of gratuitousness\u201d. (Angelus, 25 july 2021)",

We believers who receive this Eucharistic bread are spurred by Jesus to take this service to others, with his same compassion. This is the way. The narrative of the multiplication of the loaves and fish ends with the verification that everyone is satisfied and with the collection of the leftover pieces (cf. v. 20). When Jesus, with his compassion and his love, gives us a grace, forgives us our sins, embraces us, loves us; he does nothing halfway but completely. As it happens here: all are satisfied. Jesus fills our heart and our life with his love, with his forgiveness, with his compassion. Thus, Jesus allows his disciples to carry out his command. In this way they know the path to follow: to feed the people and keep them united; that is, to be at the service of life and of communion. (General Audience, 17 August 2016)"

The lamp is a symbol of the faith that illuminates our life, while the oil is a symbol of the charity that nourishes the light of faith, making it fruitful and credible. The condition for being prepared for the encounter with the Lord is not only faith, but a Christian life abundant with love and charity for our neighbour. If we allow ourselves to be guided by what seems more comfortable, by seeking our own interests, then our life becomes barren, incapable of giving life to others, and we accumulate no reserve of oil for the lamp of our faith. If instead we are watchful and seek to do good, with acts of love, of sharing, of service to a neighbour in difficulty, then we can be at peace while we wait for the bridegroom to come: the Lord can come at any moment, and even the slumber of death does not frighten us, because we have a reserve of oil, accumulated through everyday good works.

            "To undertake the discipleship of Jesus means to take up your cross \u2014 we all have one \u2014 to accompany him on his path, an uncomfortable path that is not of success or of fleeting glory, but one which takes us to true freedom, to that which frees us from selfishness and sin. It is necessary to clearly reject that worldly mentality which places one\u2019s \u201cI\u201d and one\u2019s own interests at the centre of existence. That is not what Jesus wants from us! Instead Jesus invites us to lose our life for him and for the Gospel, to receive it renewed, fulfilled and authentic. (Angelus, 13 September 2015)",
            "For whoever would save his life will lose it\u201d. Often in life, for many reasons, we go astray, looking for happiness only in things, or in people whom we treat as things. But we find happiness only when love, true love, encounters us, surprises us, changes us. Love changes everything! And love can also change us, each one of us. The witnesses of Saints proves it.

To spend one\u2019s own talents, one\u2019s energy and one\u2019s time only to save, protect and fulfil oneself, in reality leads to losing oneself, i.e. to a sad and barren existence. Instead let us live for the Lord and base our life on love, as Jesus did: we will be able to savour authentic joy, and our life will not be barren; it will be fruitful. In the Eucharistic celebration we relive the mystery of the Cross; we not only remember, but we commemorate the redeeming Sacrifice in which the Son of God completely loses Himself so as to be received anew by the Father and thus find us again, we who were lost, together with all creatures. Each time we take part in the Holy Mass, the love of the crucified and Risen Christ is conveyed to us as food and drink, so that we may follow Him on the daily path, in concrete service to our brothers and sisters.

            "In today\u2019s Gospel passage (cf. Lk 12:32-48), Jesus calls his disciples to be continually vigilant. Why? In order to understand God\u2019s transition in one\u2019s life because God continually passes through life. And he indicates the manners in which to live this vigilance properly: \u201cLet your loins be girded and your lamps burning\u201d (v. 35) This is the way. First and foremost, \u201cthe loins girded\u201d, an image that evokes the attitude of the pilgrim, ready to set out on a journey. It is a case of not putting down roots in comfortable and reassuring dwellings but rather to surrender oneself, to be open with simplicity and trust to God\u2019s passage in our lives, to the will of God who guides us towards the next destination. The Lord always walks with us and often he takes us by the hand, to guide us so that we do not err on this journey that is so difficult. (Angelus, 11 August 2019)"

It is important above all to prevent any clamour in the news and gossip in the community \u2014 this is the first thing, this must be avoided. \u201cGo and tell him his fault, between you and him alone\u201d (v. 15). The approach is one of sensitivity, prudence, humility, attention towards the one who committed a fault, to avoid wounding or killing the brother with words. Because, you know, words too can kill!

            "The approach is one of sensitivity, prudence, humility, attention towards the one who committed a fault, to avoid wounding or killing the brother with words. Because, you know, words too can kill! When I speak, when I make an unfair criticism, when I \u201cflay\u201d a brother with my tongue, this is killing another person\u2019s reputation! Words kill too. Let us pay attention to this. At the same time, the discretion of speaking to him alone is to avoid needlessly humiliating the sinner. It is discussed between the two, no one is aware of it and then it\u2019s over. It\u2019s terrible to see an insult or taunt issue from the mouth of a Christian. It is ugly. Do you understand? Do not insult! To insult is not Christian. Understood? To insult is not Christian. (Angelus, 7 September 2014)",
            "This teaching of Jesus helps us a great deal, because \u2014 let us consider an example \u2014 when we see a mistake, a fault, a slip, in that brother or sister, usually the first thing we do is to go and recount it to others, to gossip. And gossip closes the heart to the community, closes off the unity of the Church. The great gossiper is the devil, who always goes about saying bad things about others, because he is the liar who seeks to separate the Church to distance brothers and sisters and not create community. (\u2026) Let us make an effort: no gossip. It is the love of Jesus, who had embraced the tax collectors and Gentiles, scandalizing the conformists of the time. However it is not a sentence without an appeal, but a recognition that at times our human attempts may fail, and that only being before God can bring the brother to face his own conscience and responsibility for his actions. If this matter does not work, then silence and prayer for the brother or sister who has made a mistake, but never gossip. (Angelus, 6 September 2020)",
            "Today\u2019s passage speaks about fraternal correction, and invites us to reflect on the twofold dimension of Christian existence: community, which demands safeguarding communion \u2014 that is, the unity of the Church \u2014 and personal, which obliges attention and respect for every individual conscience. To correct a brother who has made a mistake, Jesus suggests a pedagogy of rehabilitation. And Jesus\u2019 pedagogy is always a pedagogy of rehabilitation. He always tries to rehabilitate, to save. And this pedagogy of rehabilitation is articulated in three passages. In the first place he says: \u201ctell him his fault, between you and him alone\u201d, that is, do not air his sin in public. It is about going to your brother with discretion, not to judge him but to help him realize what he has done. How many times have we had this experience: someone comes and tells us: \u2018But listen, you were mistaken about this. You should change a little in this regard\u2019. Perhaps in the beginning we get angry, but then we say \u2018thank you\u2019, because it is a gesture of brotherhood, of communion, of help, of rehabilitation. And it is not easy to put this teaching of Jesus into practice, for various reasons. There is the fear that the brother or sister may react badly; at times you may lack sufficient confidence with him or with her. And other reasons. But every time we have done this, we have felt it was precisely the way of the Lord. (Angelus, 6 September 2020)",
            "Today the Gospel speaks to us about fraternal correction  (cf. Mt  18:15-20), which is one of the highest expressions of love, and also one of the most demanding, because it is not easy to correct others. When a brother in faith wrongs you, then you, without rancour, help him, correct him: help by correcting. Unfortunately, however, often the first thing that is created around those who make a mistake is gossip, in which everyone comes to know the mistake, complete with details, apart from the person concerned! (\u2026) Instead, Jesus teaches us to behave in a different way. This is what he says today: \u201cIf your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone \u201d (v. 15). Speak to him about it \u201cface to face\u201d, speak about it fairly, to help him understand where he has erred. And do this for his own good, overcoming embarrassment and finding true courage, which is not to slander, but to say things to his face with meekness and gentleness. (\u2026) And if he still does not understand? Then, Jesus says, involve the community. But here too, let us be clear: this does not mean to pillory a person, putting him to shame publicly, but rather to unite everyone\u2019s efforts to help him change. Pointing the finger is not good; in fact, it often makes it more difficult for the wrongdoer to recognize his mistake. Rather, the community must make him or her feel that, while it condemns the mistake, it is close to the person with prayer and affection, always ready to offer forgiveness, understanding, and to start over.

And, this is the only way to take selfishness, greed, arrogance, vanity and worldliness, away from us. Faced with this example we find instead the attitude of those whom Jesus reproaches: \u201cpeople who follow the religion of makeup: the appearance, to appear, pretending to seem\u201d a certain way \u201cwhile inside...\u201d. Jesus evokes a very powerful image, \u201cYou are whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanliness\u201d.

            "Hypocrisy is the language of the devil, it is the language that enters our heart and is sown by the devil. You can\u2019t live with hypocritical people, but there are some. Jesus likes to unmask hypocrisy. He knows that it is precisely this hypocritical attitude that will lead to His death, because the hypocrite does not think about whether he uses lawful means or not, he goes ahead: slander? \u201cLet us commit slander.\u201d False witness? \u201cLet us look for a false witness.\u201d (Pope Francis, Santa Marta, 15 October 2019)",
            "What is hypocrisy? When we say, \u201cBe careful, that person is a hypocrite\u201d, what are we trying to say? What is hypocrisy? It can be called the fear of the truth. Hypocrites are afraid of the truth. They prefer to pretend rather than be themselves. It is like applying makeup on your soul, like putting makeup on your behaviour, putting makeup on how to proceed: it is not the truth. \u201cI am afraid of proceeding as I am and I put make up on my behaviour\u201d. To pretend hinders the courage to openly speak the truth; and thus, the obligation to speak the truth at all times, everywhere and in spite of anything, can easily be escaped. Pretending leads to this: to half-truths. And half-truths are a sham because the truth is the truth or it is not the truth. But half-truths are a way of acting that is not true. We prefer, as I said, to pretend rather than to be ourselves, and this pretence hinders the courage to openly speak the truth. (\u2026) The Gospels, too, report several situations in which Jesus strongly reproaches those who externally appear just, but who internally are filled with falsity and iniquity (cf. Mt 23:13-29). (\u2026) Let us not be afraid to be truthful, to speak the truth, to hear the truth, to conform ourselves to the truth. In this way, we will be able to love. A hypocrite does not know how to love. To act other than truthfully means jeopardizing the unity of the Church, that unity for which the Lord himself prayed. (General audience 25 August 2021)",

It says: \u201cWhy do you see the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?\u201d (v. 41). So often, as we all know, it is easy or convenient to see and condemn the flaws and sins of others, without being able to see our own with such clarity.

And we are already raised, in fact, through Baptism; we are inserted in the death and resurrection of Christ and we participate in the new life, in his life. Therefore, as we await the last day, we have within us a seed of resurrection, as an anticipation of the full resurrection which we shall receive as an inheritance. For this reason too, the body of each one of us is an echo of eternity, thus it should always be respected; and in particular, the life of those who suffer should be respected and loved, that they may feel the closeness of the Kingdom of God, of that state of eternal life towards which we are journeying.

            "I would like to emphasize three aspects of care as a contribution that women make towards greater inclusivity, greater respect for others and confronting new challenges in a new way. First, greater inclusivity. (\u2026) I have frequently insisted that diversity must never end up in inequality, but in grateful mutual acceptance. (\u2026) No one is to be excluded: this is a sacred principle. Indeed, the plan of God the Creator is a plan that is essentially and always -. (\u2026) The second contribution: greater respect for others. Each person must be respected in his or her dignity and fundamental rights (\u2026) This is particularly the case for women, who are more easily subject to violence and abuse. (\u2026) We now come to the third point: confronting new challenges in a new way. Creativity. It is undeniable that women contribute to the common good in their own unique way. (\u2026) such is the heroism of women. Apart from the clich\u00e9s of a certain genre of hagiography, these are all women of impressive determination, courage, fidelity, remarkable for their ability to persevere, even amid suffering, and to communicate joy, integrity, humility and firm resolve. (Speeches, Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice, and the Strategic Alliance of Catholic Research Universities, 11 March 2023)",
            "It is undeniable that women contribute to the common good in their own unique way. We see this already in sacred Scripture, where women frequently play a critical role at decisive moments in salvation history. We think of Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, Susanna and Ruth, culminating with Mary and the women who followed Jesus even to the cross, where \u2013 let us not forget \u2013 the only man who remained was John, the others all departed. Only the courageous remained, and they were women. Then too, in the history of the Church, we can think of women like Catherine of Siena, Josephine Bakhita, Edith Stein, Teresa of Calcutta, but also of the \u201cwomen next door\u201d, those who heroically put up with difficult marriages, children with problems... such is the heroism of women. Apart from the clich\u00e9s of a certain genre of hagiography, these are all women of impressive determination, courage, fidelity, remarkable for their ability to persevere, even amid suffering, and to communicate joy, integrity, humility and firm resolve. (\u2026) Our history abounds in women of this kind, whether famous or anonymous (albeit not to God!): women who have inspired and sustained the journey of families, societies and the Church. (\u2026) That is why, as the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council wrote, it can be said that: \u201cat this time, when humanity is experiencing such profound changes, women\u2026 can greatly assist mankind from degenerating\u201d.

The pages of this book need to be read well, without prejudices, without stereotypes, to understand the power of Job\u2019s cry.

            "Jesus set his face to go to Jerusalem\u201d (9:51). Jerusalem is the final destination where Jesus, at his last Passover, must die and rise again and thus bring his mission of salvation to fulfilment. From that moment, after that \u201cfirm decision\u201d Jesus aimed straight for his goal and in addition said clearly to the people he met and who asked to follow him what the conditions were: to have no permanent dwelling place; to know how to be detached from human affections and not to give in to nostalgia for the past. Jesus, however, also told his disciples to precede him on the way to Jerusalem and to announce his arrival, but not to impose anything: if the disciples did not find a readiness to welcome him, they should go ahead, they should move on. Jesus never imposes, Jesus is humble, Jesus invites. If you want to, come. The humility of Jesus is like this: he is always inviting but never imposing. All of this gives us food for thought. It tells us, for example, of the importance which the conscience had for Jesus too: listening in his heart to the Father\u2019s voice and following it. (\u2026) This is why we must learn to listen to our conscience more. But be careful! This does not mean following my own ego, doing what interests me, what suits me, what I like.... It is not this! The conscience is the interior place for listening to the truth, to goodness, for listening to God; it is the inner place of my relationship with him, the One who speaks to my heart and helps me to discern, to understand the way I must take and, once the decision is made, to go forward, to stay faithful.

            "When the days drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem\u201d (Lk 9:51). Thus he begins his \u201cgreat journey\u201d toward the Holy City which required a special decision because it was his last one. Filled with a still too worldly enthusiasm, the disciples dream that the Master is going to meet with triumph. Instead, Jesus knows that rejection and death await him in Jerusalem (cf. Lk 9:22, 43b-45); he knows he will have to suffer a great deal. This is what demands a resolute decision. And so, Jesus goes forward taking decisive steps toward Jerusalem. This is the same decision we must make if we want to be disciples of Jesus. What does this decision consist of? For we must be serious disciples of Jesus, truly decisive, not \u201clukewarm\u201d, as an old woman I knew used to say. No! Decisive Christians. (\u2026) Now let us ask ourselves: At what point are we? What point are we at? In the face of opposition, misunderstanding, do we turn to the Lord? Do we ask him for his steadfastness in doing good? Or do we rather seek confirmation through applause, ending up being bitter and resentful when we do not hear it? (\u2026) Let us thus ask Jesus for the strength to be like him, to follow him resolutely down the path of service, not to be vindictive, not to be intolerant when difficulties present themselves, when we spend ourselves in doing good and others do not understand this, or even when they disqualify us. No, silence and onward. (Angelus, 26 June 2022)"

A mustard seed is tiny, yet Jesus says that faith this size, small but true and sincere, suffices to achieve what is humanly impossible, unthinkable. And it is true! We all know people who are simple, humble, but whose faith is so strong it can move mountains! Let us think, for example, of some mothers and fathers who face very difficult situations; or of some sick, and even gravely ill, people who transmit serenity to those who come to visit them. And how do we draw from this strength? We draw it from God in prayer.

But this master\u2019s very way of doing things highlights what is the true core of the parable, which is the servant\u2019s attitude of willingness.

Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u201d(EXTRAORDINARY JUBILEE OF MERCY, MARIAN JUBILEE, Sunday, 9 October 2016)",
            "How important it is to know how give thanks, to know how to praise the Lord for what he has done for us!  So we can ask ourselves: Are we capable of saying \u201cThank you\u201d?  How many times do we say \u201cThank you\u201d in our family, in our community, and in the Church?  How many times do we say \u201cThank you\u201d to those who help us, to those close to us, to those who accompany us through life?  We often take everything for granted!  This even happens with God.  It is easy to go to the Lord to ask for something, but to return and give thanks...  (Marian Jubilee Homily, 9 October 2016)",
            "This narrative, so to speak, divides the world in two: those who do not give thanks and those who do; those who take everything as if it is owed them, and those who welcome everything as a gift, as grace\u2026The prayer of thanksgiving always begins from here: from the recognition that grace precedes us. We were thought of before we learned how to think; we were loved before we learned how to love; we were desired before our hearts conceived a desire. If we view life like this, then \u201cthank you\u201d becomes the driving force of our day. (General Audience, 30 December 2020)",
            "Human history, like the personal history of each of us, cannot be understood as a simple succession of meaningless words and facts. Nor can it be interpreted in the light of a fatalistic vision, as if all were already preordained according to a fate that removes any space for freedom, preventing us from making choices as the fruit of true decision. In today\u2019s Gospel passage, however, Jesus says that the history of peoples and that of individuals have a purpose and an aim to fulfil: the definitive encounter with the Lord.  Let us invoke the intercession of the Virgin Mary that, with the verification of our impermanence on earth and of our limitations, she not allow us to collapse into anguish, but call us back to responsibility for ourselves, for our neighbour, for the entire world. (Angelus, 18 November 2018)",
            "This narrative, so to speak, divides the world in two: those who do not give thanks and those who do; those who take everything as if it is owed them, and those who welcome everything as a gift, as grace. The Catechism says: \u201cevery event and need can become an offering of thanksgiving\u201d (n. 2638). The prayer of thanksgiving always begins from here: from the recognition that grace precedes us. We were thought of before we learned how to think; we were loved before we learned how to love; we were desired before our hearts conceived a desire. If we view life like this, then \u201cthank you\u201d becomes the driving force of our day. And how often we even forget to say \u201cthank you\u201d. (General audience, 30 December 2020)",
            "Naturally, they were all happy about having recovered their health, thus being allowed to end that unending forced quarantine that excluded them from the community. But among them, there was one who experienced an additional joy: in addition to being healed, he rejoices at the encounter with Jesus. He is not only freed from evil, but he now possesses the certainty of being loved. This is the crux: when you thank someone, you express the certainty that you are loved. And this is a huge step: to have the certainty that you are loved. It is the discovery of love as the force that governs the world. The prayer of thanksgiving always begins from here: from the recognition that grace precedes us. We were thought of before we learned how to think; we were loved before we learned how to love; we were desired before our hearts conceived a desire. If we view life like this, then \u201cthank you\u201d becomes the driving force of our day. (General audience, 30 December 2020)",
            "In the group of the ten lepers, there was only one who, realizing that he was cured, turned back to praise God and to show gratitude to Jesus. The other nine were healed, but then went their own way, forgetting the one who had healed them. (\u2026) It is essential to know how to say \u201cthank you\u201d. To thank the Lord each day and to thank one another. In our families, for the little gifts we receive daily and so often do not even think about. In the places we spend our days, for the many services which we enjoy and for all those people who support us. In our Christian communities, for the love of God that we experience in the closeness of our brothers and sisters who, often silently, pray, sacrifice, suffer and journey with us. So please, let us not forget to say these key words: thank you! (Homily, Canonization of Giovanni Battista Scalabrini and Artemide Zatti, 9 October 2022)"

            "Faith passes through a still, so to speak, and becomes ideology. And ideology doesn't share. There is no room for Jesus in the ideologies: his tenderness, love, meekness. And the ideologies are rigid, always. In every way: rigid. And when a Christian becomes disciple of Jesus, he is a disciple of this attitude of thought ... This is way Jesus says to them: \"You have taken away the key of knowledge\". The knowledge of Jesus is turned into an ideological and even moralistic knowledge, because these people close the door with thei many prescriptions\". (Santa Marta, 17 October, 2013)",
            "This is why Jesus himself may seem a little hostile against the doctors of the law, because he things harshly to them: \u201cyou have taken away the key of knowledge, you did not enter, and you have hindered those who were entering, because you have taken away the key\u201d, that is, the key of gratuitous salvation, of that knowledge. (...) But the source is love; the horizon is love. If you have closed the door and have taken away the key of love, you are not worthy of the gratuitous salvation you have received.

Jesus was faithful and obeyed the Word of the Father, but ended up on the cross. With how much tenderness Jesus said to the disciples on the Road to Emmaus, 'Oh you foolish and slow of heart.' Let us ask the Lord to look to the large and to the small follies of our hearts with the same tenderness, to caress us gently and to say to us: \u2018Oh you foolish and slow of heart\u2019 and begin to explain things to us.

However, in the midst of the storm, Christians must not lose hope, thinking that they have been abandoned. Jesus assures his disciples: \u201ceven the hairs on your head are all numbered\u201d (Mt 10:30); as if to say that none of man\u2019s suffering, not even that which is most minute and hidden, is invisible to the eyes of God. God sees and certainly protects; and he will give his redemption. There is in fact in our midst Someone who is stronger than evil, stronger than the mafia, than the obscure conspiracies of those who profit at the expense of desperate people, than those who crush others with disdain.... Someone who has always listened to the cry of Abel\u2019s blood from the earth. (General Audience, 28 June 2017)",

The gratuitousness of salvation is forgotten; the closeness of God is forgotten, and the mercy of God is forgotten. And those who forget the gratuitousness of salvation, the closeness of God, and the mercy of God, have taken away the key to knowledge. (\u2026)\nThis happens even today. The Pharisees, the doctors of the law, are not just figures of those times; even today, there are many. This is why it is necessary to pray for us shepherds. To pray, so that we do not lose the key to knowledge and do not close the door to ourselves and to the people who want to enter. (Santa Marta, 19 October 2017)",
            "This leads us to understand the revelation of God, to understand God's heart, to understand God's salvation - the key to knowledge - we can say it is very neglected. One forgets the freedom of salvation; forgetting the closeness of God and forgetting God's mercy. And those who forget the gift of salvation, the closeness of God, and the mercy of God, have taken away the key to knowledge. (\u2026) For them, God is the one who has made the law. But this is not the God of revelation. The God of revelation is a God who has begun to walk with us from Abraham to Jesus Christ, God walking with His people. And when you lose this close relationship with the Lord, you fall into this dull mindset that believes in the self-sufficiency of salvation with the fulfillment of the law. The closeness of God.

Let us ask the Lord for a faith that is incessant prayer, persevering, like that of the widow in the parable, a faith that nourishes our desire for his coming. And in prayer let us experience that compassion of God, who like a Father comes to encounter his children, full of merciful love. (General audience, 25 May 2016)\n ",

            "We all go through times of tiredness and discouragement, especially when our prayers seem ineffective. But Jesus assures us: unlike the dishonest judge, God promptly answers His children, even though this does not mean He will necessarily do it when and how we would like. Prayer is not a magic wand! It helps us keep faith in God, and to entrust ourselves to Him even when we do not understand His will. (General Audience, 25 May 2016)",
            "The teaching of the Gospel is clear: we need to pray always, even when everything seems in vain, when God appears to be deaf and mute and it seems we are wasting time. Even if heaven is overshadowed, the Christian does not stop praying. A Christian\u2019s prayer keeps stride with his or her faith. And many days of our life, faith seems to be an illusion, a barren struggle. There are moments of darkness in our life, and in those moments, faith seems to be an illusion. But the practice of prayer means accepting this struggle too. (General Audience, 11 November 2020)",
            "In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus poses a dramatic question that always makes us reflect: \u201cWhen the Son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?\u201d (Lk 18:8), or will he find only organizations, like groups of \u201centrepreneurs of faith\u201d, everyone well organized, doing charitable works, many things \u2026 or will he find faith? \u201cWhen the Son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?\u201d. This question comes at the end of a parable that demonstrates the need to pray with perseverance, without tiring (cf. vv. 1-8). Therefore, we can conclude that the lamp of faith will always be lit on earth as long as there is the oil of prayer. The lamp of the Church\u2019s true faith will always be lit on earth as long as there is the oil of prayer. It is this that leads faith forward, and leads forward our poor, weak, sinful life, but prayer leads it securely forward. The question that we Christians need to ask ourselves is: Do I pray? Do we pray? How do I pray? (General Audience, 14 April 2021)",

            "This is a serious question. Let us imagine that the Lord came on earth today. Unfortunately, he would see many wars, much poverty and many inequalities, and at the same time, tremendous technical achievements, modern means, and people who are always rushing, who never stop. But would he find someone who dedicates time and affection to him, someone who would put him in first place? Above all, let us ask ourselves, \u201cWhat would he find in me, if the Lord were to come today, what would he find in me, in my life, in my heart? What priorities would he see in my life?\u201d\nWe often focus on so many urgent but unnecessary things. We occupy and preoccupy ourselves with so many secondary realities. And perhaps without even realizing it, we neglect what matters most and we allow our love for God to grow cold, to grow cold bit by bit. Today, Jesus offers us the remedy to rekindle a tepid faith. And what is the remedy? Prayer. Prayer is the medicine for faith, it is a tonic for the soul. However, it needs to be constant prayer.\nHow often we send text messages to the people we love! Let us do this with the Lord as well so that our hearts remain connected to him. And let us not forget to read his responses. The Lord always responds. Where do we find them? In the Gospel which should always be kept at hand and should be opened several times every day, to receive a Word of life directed to us. (Angelus, 16 October 2022)",
            "God invites us to pray insistently not because he is unaware of our needs or because he is not listening to us. On the contrary, he is always listening and he knows everything about us lovingly. On our daily journey, especially in times of difficulty, in the battle against the evil that is outside and within us, the Lord is not far away, he is by our side. We battle with him beside us, and our weapon is prayer which makes us feel his presence beside us, his mercy and also his help. But the battle against evil is a long and hard one; it requires patience and endurance, like Moses who had to keep his arms outstretched for the people to prevail (cf Ex 17:8-13). This is how it is: there is a battle to be waged each day, but God is our ally, faith in him is our strength and prayer is the expression of this faith. Therefore Jesus assures us of the victory, but at the end he asks: \u201cwhen the Son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?\u201d (Lk 18:8). If faith is snuffed out, prayer is snuffed out, and we walk in the dark. We become lost on the path of life. (Angelus, 20 October 2013)"

Jesus, pray for me to the Father!\u2019 It is His work today: praying for us, for His Church. We often forget this, that Jesus prays for us. This is our strength: to be able to say to the Father, \u2018But if you, Father, will not consider us, consider your Son who prays for us.\u2019 From the first moment Jesus prays: He prayed when He was on earth and He continues to pray now for each one of us, for the whole Church.

He is not a professor, a teacher, a mystic who is far from the people and speaks from the professor\u2019s chair [It: cattedra]. No! He is in the midst of the people, He lets them touch Him, He lets them ask of Him. That\u2019s Jesus: close to the people. And this nearness is not something new for Him. He emphasizes it in His way of acting, but it is something that comes out of God\u2019s first choice of His people. God says to His people, \u2018Consider: What people has a God as close as I am to you?\u2019 God\u2019s closeness to His people is the closeness of Jesus amid the crowds.

With His preaching He proclaims the Kingdom of God, and with His healing He shows that it is near, that the Kingdom of God is in our midst. Having come to earth to proclaim and to effect the salvation of the entire person and of all people, Jesus shows a particular predilection for those who are wounded in body and in spirit: the poor, sinners, the possessed, the sick, the marginalized. Thus, He reveals Himself as a doctor both of souls and of bodies, our Good Samaritan. He is the true Saviour: Jesus saves, Jesus cures, Jesus heals. (Angelus, 8 February 2015)",

The strength of being able to say to the Father: \u2018But if you, Father, do not see us, look at your Son who is praying for us\u2019. From the first moment Jesus prays: he prayed when he was on earth and he continues to pray now for each of us, for all the Church. This is about love! Love does not look to see whether one\u2019s face is ugly or fair: He loves! And Jesus does the same: he loves and chooses with love. And he chooses everyone. On his list there are no important people according to worldly criteria: there are common people. The only feature which characterizes them all is that they are sinners. Jesus chose sinners. He chooses sinners. Jesus calls everyone! We remember in the parable of the marriage feast of the son: when the guests did not come, what did the master do? He sent his servants: \u2018Go and bring everyone home! The good and the bad\u2019, the Gospel says. Jesus chose everyone. (Homily, Santa Marta \u2013 9 September 2014)",
            "Peter shows himself to be docile by leaving everything, and in this way, he becomes a disciple. Instead, those who are too attached to their own ideas and their own securities, find it difficult to truly follow Jesus. They follow him a little, only in those things in which \u201cI agree with him and he agrees with me\u201d, but then, as far as the rest is concerned, it goes no further. And this is not a disciple. And so, they fall into sadness. They become sad because things don\u2019t add up, because reality escapes their thinking patterns and they find they are dissatisfied. Disciples, on the other hand, know how to question themselves, how to humbly seek God every day, and this allows them to delve into reality, grasping its richness and complexity. (Angelus, 13 February 2022)",
            "The Gospels show us how prayer was fundamental in the relationship between Jesus and his disciples. This can already be seen in the choice of those who would later become the Apostles. Luke places their election in a precise context of prayer, and he says: \u201cIn these days he went out to the mountain to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles\u201d (6:12-13). Jesus chooses them after a night of prayer. It seems that there is no criterion in this choice other than prayer, the dialogue of Jesus with the Father. Judging from how those men were to behave, it would seem that the choice was not the best, as they all fled, they left him alone before the Passion; but it is precisely this, especially the presence of Judas, the future betrayer, that demonstrates that those names were inscribed in God\u2019s plan. Prayer on behalf of his friends continually resurfaces in the life of Jesus. The Apostles sometimes become a cause of concern for him, but as he had received them from the Father, after prayer, Jesus carries them in his heart, even in their errors, even when they fall. In all this we discover how Jesus was both teacher and friend, always willing to wait patiently for the disciple\u2019s conversion. (General audience, 2 June 2021)",
            "Jesus went out into the hills to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God. And then comes all the rest: the people, the selection of the disciples, the healings, the casting out of demons. Therefore, \u201cthe cornerstone is Jesus, yes: but, it is a Jesus who prays\u201d. And \u201cJesus prays: he prayed and continues to pray for the Church\u201d. Thus, \u201cthe cornerstone of the Church is the Lord standing before the Father who intercedes for us, who prays for us: we pray to him, but the foundation is him who prays for us\u201d. (\u2026) On the mount of Olives, Jesus prayed; on the Cross, he died praying: his life ended in prayer\u201d. And \u201cthis is our security, this is our foundation, this is our cornerstone: Jesus who prays for us, Jesus who prays for me\u201d. For this reason \u201ceach of us can say: \u2018I am certain that Jesus prays for me, that he is before the Father and gives me a name\u2019\u201d. Therefore, the cornerstone of the Church is Jesus in prayer\u201d. (\u2026) Let us think about this, \u201cbefore the Passion, when Jesus turned to Peter with that warning which echoes the first chapter of the book of Job: \u201cSimon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail\u201d. It \u201cis lovely\u201d to consider how the words which Jesus says to Peter are also said \u201cto you, to me, and to everyone: \u2018I prayed for you, I pray for you, I am now praying for you\u2019\u201d. And \u201cwhen he comes upon the altar, he comes to intercede, to pray for us, just like on the Cross\u201d. This \u201cgives us great confidence: I belong to this community, which is steadfast because it has Jesus as its cornerstone, a Jesus who prays for me, who prays for us\u201d. Finally, Francis invited the faithful to \u201creflect on this mystery of the Church: we are all like a building, but the foundation is Jesus, it is Jesus who prays for us. It is Jesus who prays for me\u201d. (Santa Marta, 28 October 2016)"

            "What is God\u2019s will, incarnated in Jesus?. To seek and to save the one who is lost. And in prayer, we ask that God\u2019s seeking may be successful, that his universal plan of salvation may be accomplished, firstly in each of us, and then in the entire world. Have you thought about what it means that God seeks me? Each one of us can say: \u2018But does God seek me?\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Yes! he seeks you! He seeks me\u2019: he seeks each one of us, personally. But God is great! How much love there is behind all this. God knocks upon the door of our heart with his love. Why? To attract us, to attract us to him and to carry us forward on the path of salvation. God is close to each of us, with his love, to lead us by the hand to salvation. How much love there is behind this! Therefore, by praying \u201cthy will be done\u201d, we are not called to subserviently bow our head as if we were slaves. No! God wants us to be free; his love frees us. Indeed, the \u201cOur Father\u201d is the prayer of children, not of slaves; but of children who know their father\u2019s heart and are certain of his loving plan. Woe to us if, in uttering these words, we should shrug our shoulders as a sign of surrender to a destiny we find repellant and that we are unable to change. On the contrary, it is a prayer that is filled with ardent trust in God who wants good, life and salvation for us. A courageous, even militant prayer, because there are many, too many realities in the world that are not in accordance with God\u2019s plan. (General audience, 20 march 2019)",

It is the mystery of the Lord\u2019s great mercy.\nAnd then hope. Today is a day of remembrance in order to look forward, to look at our journey, our path. We walk towards an encounter, with the Lord and with everyone. And we must ask the Lord for this grace of hope: the hope that never lets us down; the hope that is the everyday virtue that carries us forward, that helps us to solve problems and to look for ways out. But always forward, forward. That fruitful hope, that every-day theological virtue, one for any moment: I will call it a theological virtue of \u201cthe kitchen\u201d, because it is approachable and always comes to our aid. Hope never disappoints: we live in this tension between memory and hope. (\u2026)\nToday, thinking of the dead, preserving the memory of the dead and preserving hope, let us ask the Lord for peace, that people may no longer be killed in wars. So many innocent dead, so many soldiers who leave their lives behind. But why is this? Wars are always a defeat, always. There is no total victory, no. Yes, one conquers the other, but beneath there is always the defeat of the price that is paid. Let us pray to the Lord for our departed, for everyone, for everyone: may the Lord receive them all. And let us also pray for the Lord to have pity on us and give us hope: the hope to press on and to be able to find them all together with Him, when He calls us. So be it.

When I do not know what to do, how to make a definitive choice, an important decision, a decision that involves Jesus\u2019 love, what must I do? Before deciding, let us imagine that we are standing in front of Jesus, as at the end of life, before he who is love. And imagining ourselves there, in his presence, at the threshold of eternity, we make the decision for today. We must decide in this way: always looking to eternity, looking at Jesus. It may not be the easiest, it may not be the most immediate, but it will be the right one (cf. Saint Ignatius of Loyola, Spiritual Exercises, 187), that is certain. (Angelus, 14 November 2021)"

            "It is no use knowing that the Risen One is alive, unless we too live as risen ones.  It is the Spirit who makes Jesus live within us; he raises us up from within. That is why when Jesus appears to his disciples, he repeats the words, \u201cPeace be with you!\u201d (Jn 20:19.21), and bestows the Spirit.  That is what peace really is, the peace bestowed on the Apostles.  That peace does not have to do with resolving outward problems \u2013 God does not spare his disciples from tribulation and persecution.  Rather, it has to do with receiving the Holy Spirit.  The peace bestowed on the apostles, the peace that does not bring freedom from problems but in problems, is offered to each of us. (Holy Mass on yhe Solemnity of Pentecost, 9 june 2019)",
            "Let us try asking ourselves: am I open to the action of the Holy Spirit? Do I pray him to give me illumination, to make me more sensitive to God\u2019s things? This is a prayer we must pray every day: \u201cHoly Spirit, make my heart open to the word of God, make my heart open to goodness, make my heart open to the beauty of God every day\u201d. I would like to ask everyone a question: how many of you pray every day to the Holy Spirit? There will not be many but we must fulfil Jesus\u2019 wish and pray every day to the Holy Spirit that he open our heart to Jesus. (General Audience, 15 May 2013)",
            "Let us go back to the origin of the Church, to the day of Pentecost. Let us look at the Apostles [\u2026] They were all different. Jesus did not change them; He did not make them into a set of pre-packaged models. No. He left their differences and now He unites them by anointing them with the Holy Spirit. With the anointing comes their union \u2013 union in diversity. At Pentecost, the Apostles understand the unifying power of the Spirit. They see it with their own eyes when everyone, though speaking in different languages, comes together as one people: the people of God, shaped by the Spirit, Who weaves unity from diversity and bestows harmony because in the Spirit there is harmony. He Himself is harmony. [\u2026] Let us begin anew from here; let us look at the Church with the eyes of the Spirit and not as the world does. The world sees us only as on the right or left, with one ideology or the other; the Spirit sees us as sons and daughters of the Father and brothers and sisters of Jesus. The world sees conservatives and progressives; the Spirit sees children of God. A worldly gaze sees structures to be made more efficient; a spiritual gaze sees brothers and sisters pleading for mercy. The Spirit loves us and knows everyone\u2019s place in the grand scheme of things: for Him, we are not bits of confetti blown about by the wind, rather we are irreplaceable fragments in His mosaic.

Therefore, in that moment of apparent failure, where everything is dark, Jesus prays, praising the Father. And his prayer also leads us, readers of the Gospel, to judge our personal defeats in a different way, to judge differently the situations in which we do not see clearly the presence and action of God, when it seems that evil prevails and there is no way to stop it. Jesus, who highly recommended the prayer of asking, at the very moment when he would have had reason to ask the Father for explanations, instead begins to praise him. It seems to be a contradiction, but therein lies the truth. (General audience, 13 January 2021)",
            "The Lord does not reserve this phrase for certain friends of his, no; he addresses it to \u201call\u201d those who are weary and overwhelmed by life. And who could feel excluded from this invitation? The Lord knows how arduous life can be. He knows that many things weary the heart: disappointments and wounds of the past, burdens to carry and wrongs to bear in the present, uncertainties and worries about the future. In the face of all this, Jesus\u2019 first word is an invitation, a call to move and respond: \u201cCome\u201d. The mistake, when things go wrong, is to stay where we are, lying there. It seems obvious, but how difficult it is to respond and open ourselves! It is not easy. In dark times it feels natural to keep to ourselves, to ruminate over how unfair life is, over how ungrateful others are, how mean the world is, and so on. We all know it. We have had this awful experience a few times. But in this way, locked up inside ourselves, we see everything as grim. Then we even grow accustomed to sadness, which becomes like home: that sadness overcomes us; this sadness is a terrible thing. Jesus, however, wants to pull us out of this \u201cquicksand\u201d and thus says to each one: \u201cCome! \u2014 Who?  \u2014  You, you, you\u201d. The way out is in connecting, in extending a hand and lifting our gaze to those who truly love us. (Angelus, 9 July 2017)",

But what things is Jesus talking about? And then, who are these \u201cbabes\u201d to whom such things are revealed? Let us reflect on this: on the things for which Jesus praises his Father and on the \u201cbabes\u201d who know how to welcome them. (\u2026) God reveals himself by liberating and healing the human person. Let us not forget this: God reveals himself by liberating and healing the human person, and he does this with a gratuitous love, a love that saves. This is why Jesus praises his father, because his greatness consists in love and he never works outside of love. But this greatness in love is not understood by those who presume to be great and who fabricate a god in their own image \u2014 powerful, inflexible, vindictive.(\u2026) The little children, instead, know how to welcome them, and Jesus praises the Father for them: \u201cI bless you,\u201d he says, because you have revealed the Kingdom of Heaven to the little ones. Jesus praises him for the simple people whose hearts are free from presumption and self-love. The little ones are those who, like children, feel their need and are not self-sufficient. They are open to God and allow themselves to be amazed at his works. They know how to read his signs, to marvel at the miracles of his love! (\u2026) This is the correct behaviour to have before God\u2019s works: to take a photograph of his works in our minds so that they may be impressed in our hearts, and then developed in our lives through many good deeds, so that this \u201cphotograph\u201d of God, who is love, becomes ever brighter in us and through us.

They suffer for the Gospel with love, they are martyrs of our days.

When, instead, love for parents and children is inspired and purified by love for the Lord, it then becomes wholly fruitful and produces good fruits within the family itself and well beyond it. Then, Jesus says to his disciples: \u201che who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me\u201d (Mt 10:38). This means following him along the path that he himself trod, without looking for shortcuts. There is no true love without the cross, that is, without a personal price to pay. Many mothers, many fathers who sacrifice a great deal for their children, and bear true sacrifices, crosses, because they love them, say this. And the cross is not frightening when borne with Jesus, because he is always at our side to support us in the hour of the most difficult trial, to give us strength and courage.

            "It's fear. When there is a storm at sea, waves swamp the boat. \u201cSave us, Lord, we are perishing!\u201d they say. Fear is also a temptation of the devil: to be afraid to continue on the Lord\u2019s path. (Santa Marta, 2 July 2013)",
            "It is exactly like this. We must wake up Christ in our hearts and only then will we be able to contemplate things with his eyes for he sees beyond the storm. Through that serene gaze, we can see a panorama that we cannot even glimpse on our own. (General Audience, 10 Nov 2021)",
            "Today we can ask ourselves: what are the winds that beat against my life? What are the waves that hinder my navigation, and put my spiritual life, my family life, even my psychological life in danger? Let us say all this to Jesus; let us tell him everything. He wants this; he wants us to grab hold of him to find shelter from the unexpected waves in life. The Gospel recounts that the disciples approach Jesus, wake him and speak to him (cf. v. 38). This is the beginning of our faith: to recognize that alone we are unable to stay afloat; that we need Jesus like sailors need the stars to find their course. Faith begins from believing that we are not enough for ourselves, from feeling in need of God. When we overcome the temptation to close ourselves off, when we overcome the false religiosity that does not want to disturb God, when we cry out to him, he can work wonders in us. It is the gentle and extraordinary power of prayer, which works miracles. Jesus, begged by the disciples, calms the wind and waves. And he asks them a question, a question which also pertains to us: \u201cWhy are you afraid? Have you no faith?\u201d (v. 40). The disciples were gripped with fear, because they were focused on the waves more than on looking at Jesus. (\u2026) It is this way for us too: how often we remain fixated on problems rather than going to the Lord and casting our concerns to him! (Angelus, 20 June 2021)",
            "Even before we begin to seek Him, He is present beside us lifting us back up after our falls, He helps us grow in faith. Maybe in the dark, we cry out: \u201cLord, Lord!\u201d thinking He is far away. And He says, \u201cI am here.\u201d Ah, He was with me! That is the Lord. The boat at the mercy of the storm is the image of the Church, which in every age encounters headwinds, very harsh trials at times: we recall certain long and ferocious persecutions of the last century and even today in certain places. In situations like that, she may be tempted to think that God has abandoned her. But in reality it is precisely in those moments that the witness of faith, the witness of love, the witness of hope shines the most. It is the presence of the Risen Christ in His Church that gives the grace of witness unto martyrdom, from which buds new Christians and fruit of reconciliation and peace for the entire world. May the intercession of Mary help us to persevere in faith and fraternal love when the darkness and storms of life place our trust in God in crisis. (Angelus, 9 August 2020)"

In this regard the young man has nothing to reproach; but Jesus also understood his interlocutor\u2019s weakness, and offers him a practical proposal: to give all his possessions to the poor and follow Him.

How many times are we satisfied with doing our duties \u2014 the precepts, a few prayers, and many things like that \u2014 whereas God, who gives us life, asks us for leaps of life! In today\u2019s Gospel we can see this passage from duty to giving, clearly; Jesus begins by recalling the Commandments: \u201cDo not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal\u2026.\u201d, and so on (v. 19) and arrives at a positive proposal: \u201cGo, sell, give, follow me!\u201d (cf. v. 21).

Love for God is expressed above all in prayer, particularly in adoration. We neglect the adoration of God a great deal. We recite the prayer of thanksgiving, the supplication to ask for something..., but we neglect adoration. Adoring God is precisely the heart of prayer. And love for neighbour, which is also called fraternal charity, consists in closeness, listening, sharing, caring for others. And so often we neglect to listen to others because it is boring or because it takes up our time, or [we neglect] to accompany them, to support them in their suffering, in their trials.... The Apostle John writes: \u201che who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen \u201d (1 Jn 4:20). Thus, we see the unity of these two commandments.

A communion that is a gift to be requested each day, but also a personal commitment not to let our lives become enslaved by the idols of the world. And the proof of our journey of conversion and holiness always consists in love of neighbour. This is the test: if I say \u201cI love God\u201d and do not love my neighbour, it does not work. The verification that I love God is that I love my neighbour. As long as there is a brother or sister to whom we close our hearts, we will still be far from being disciples as Jesus asks us. But his divine mercy does not allow us to be discouraged, but rather calls us to begin anew each day to live the Gospel consistently. (Angelus, 25 October 2020)"

It was revealed to you by \u201cmy Father who is in heaven\u201d (v. 17). To confess Jesus is a grace of the Father. To say that Jesus is the Son of the living God, that he is the Redeemer, is a grace that we must ask for: \u201cFather, give me the grace to confess Jesus\u201d. (Angelus, 23 August 2020)\n "

This shall never happen\u201d. But Jesus reminds us that his way is the way of love, and that there is no true love without self sacrifice. We are called to not let ourselves be absorbed by the vision of this world, but to be ever more aware of the need and of the effort for we Christians to walk against the current and uphill. Jesus completes his proposal with words that express a great and ever valid wisdom, because they challenge the egocentric mentality and behaviour. He exhorts: \u201cwhoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it (v. 25). This paradox contains the golden rule that God inscribed in the human nature created in Christ: the rule that only love gives meaning and happiness to life. To spend one\u2019s own talents, one\u2019s energy and one\u2019s time only to save, protect and fulfil oneself, in reality leads to losing oneself, i.e. to a sad and barren existence. Instead let us live for the Lord and base our life on love, as Jesus did: we will be able to savour authentic joy, and our life will not be barren; it will be fruitful. (Angelus, 3 September 2017)"

And celebrate the date of your Baptism in your heart, every year. (Angelus 12 January 2020)",
            "The Liturgy has us take a leap of some 30 years, 30 years about which we know one thing: they were years of hidden life, which Jesus spent with his family \u2014 some, firstly in Egypt, as a migrant to escape Herod\u2019s persecution, the others in Nazareth, learning Joseph\u2019s trade \u2014 with family, obeying his parents, studying and working. It is striking that the Lord spent most of his time on Earth in this way: living an ordinary life, without standing out. We think that, according to the Gospels, there were three years of preaching, of miracles and many things. Three. And the others, all the others, were of a hidden life with his family. It is a fine message for us: it reveals the greatness of daily life , the importance in God\u2019s eyes of every gesture and moment of life, even the simplest, even the most hidden. (Angelus, 10 Jan 2021)",
            "After these 30 years of hidden life, Jesus\u2019 public life begins. And it begins precisely with his baptism in the River Jordan. But Jesus is God; why does Jesus get baptized? John\u2019s baptism consisted in a penitential rite; it was a sign of one\u2019s willingness to convert, to be better, asking forgiveness of one\u2019s sins. Jesus surely did not need it. In fact, John the Baptist tries to prevent it, but Jesus insists. Why? Because he wants to be with the sinners: for this reason he gets in line with them and does the same thing they do. (\u2026)\nAfter this gesture of compassion by Jesus, an extraordinary thing happens: the heavens open and the Trinity is finally revealed. The Holy Spirit descends from the heavens in the form of a dove (cf. Mk 1:10) and the Father says to Jesus: \u201cThou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased\u201d (v. 11). God manifests himself when mercy appears. Do not forget this: God manifests himself when mercy appears, because that is his face. Jesus becomes the servant of sinners and is proclaimed the Son; he lowers himself upon us and the Spirit descends upon him. Love calls upon love. It also applies to us: in each act of service, in every work of mercy we perform, God manifests himself; God sets his gaze upon the world. (Angelus, 10 Jan 2021)"

What are the waves that hinder my navigation, and put my spiritual life, my family life, even my psychological life in danger? Let us say all this to Jesus; let us tell him everything. He wants this; he wants us to grab hold of him to find shelter from the unexpected waves in life. The Gospel recounts that the disciples approach Jesus, wake him and speak to him (cf. v. 38). This is the beginning of our faith: to recognize that alone we are unable to stay afloat; that we need Jesus like sailors need the stars to find their course. Faith begins from believing that we are not enough for ourselves, from feeling in need of God. When we overcome the temptation to close ourselves off, when we overcome the false religiosity that does not want to disturb God, when we cry out to him, he can work wonders in us. It is the gentle and extraordinary power of prayer, which works miracles.\nJesus, begged by the disciples, calms the wind and waves. And he asks them a question, a question which also pertains to us: \u201cWhy are you afraid? Have you no faith?\u201d (v. 40). The disciples were gripped with fear, because they were focused on the waves more than on looking at Jesus. And fear leads us to look at the difficulties, the awful problems, and not to look at the Lord, who many times is sleeping. It is this way for us too: how often we remain fixated on problems rather than going to the Lord and casting our concerns to him! How often we leave the Lord in a corner, at the bottom of the boat of life, to wake him only in a moment of need!

Rather, it means to choose in full freedom to take responsibility for one\u2019s life as it comes. This is why Joseph gives us an important lesson. He chooses Mary with \u201chis eyes open\u201d. We can say \u201cwith all the risks\u201d. (General audience, 1 December 2021)",
            "Saint Joseph (\u2026) In fact, he is first and foremost the guardian of Jesus and the Virgin Mary. And, therefore, he is also the patron saint of the Church. (\u2026) You can entrust to him certain situations that are rather complicated, when you realise that your own strength is not enough, that there are no solutions at hand. Then you can turn to Saint Joseph in prayer. He is a man of few words - in the Gospel he never speaks, there are no words of Joseph - of few words but of many deeds. Try it. A man who listens to God\u2019s will and puts it into practice, without hesitation. I always pray to him, for this need, that other, and he always answers. (\u2026) God's plans are not always clear; they often take time to manifest themselves, they require patience; above all, they require faith, a great deal of trust that God wants only and always the good, the greatest good for us and our loved ones. And so we must do as Saint Joseph did: abandon ourselves to God - this is what sleep means - to receive his messages. (Pope Francis to Vatican Employees, 23 December 2021)"

This peace, in reality, is only an interval between wars: we are well aware of this. The peace of the Lord follows the way of meekness and mildness: it is taking responsibility for others. Indeed, Christ took on himself our evil, sin and our death. He took all of this upon himself. In this way he freed us. He paid for us. His peace is not the fruit of some compromise, but rather is born of self-giving. This meek and courageous peace, though, is difficult to accept. (General audience, 13 April 2022)",

He incarnated it precisely in the most difficult moment, and He wants us to behave that way too, since we are the heirs of His peace. He wants us to be meek, open, available to listen, capable of defusing tensions and weaving harmony. This is witnessing to Jesus and is worth more than a thousand words and many sermons. The witness of peace. As disciples of Jesus, let us ask ourselves if we behave like this where we live: Do we ease tensions, do we defuse conflicts? Are we too at odds with someone, always ready to react, explode; or do we know how to respond non-violently, do we know how to respond with peaceful actions and words? How do I react? Everyone should ask themselves this. Certainly, this meekness is not easy. How difficult it is, at every level, to defuse conflicts! Jesus\u2019 second phrase comes to our aid here: My peace I give you. Jesus knows that on our own we are not able to keep peace, that we need help, that we need a gift. Peace, which is our obligation, is first of all a gift of God. In fact, Jesus says, \u201cMy peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you\u201d (Jn 14:27).

Jesus summarized his commandments in a single one, this: \u201cthat you love one another as I have loved you\u201d (v. 12). To love as Jesus Christ means to offer yourself in service, at the service of your brothers and sisters, as he did in washing the feet of the disciples. It also means going outside of ourselves, detaching ourselves from our own human certainties, from earthly comforts, in order to open ourselves up to others, especially those in greater need. It means making ourselves available, as we are and with what we have. This means to love not in word but in deeds. (Regina Caeli, 9 May 2021)",

To live in the flow of God\u2019s love, to take up permanent residence there, is the condition to ensure that our love does not lose its ardour and boldness along the way. Like Jesus and in Him, we too must welcome with gratitude the love that comes from the Father and abide in this love, trying to avoid being separated from it by egoism and sin. It is a demanding project but it is not impossible. First and foremost, it is important to realize that Christ\u2019s love is not a superficial feeling, no; it is a fundamental attitude of the heart which is manifested in living as He wishes. In fact, Jesus states: \u201cIf you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and abide in his love\u201d (Jn 15:10). Love is fulfilled in everyday life, in attitudes, in deeds. Otherwise, it is only something illusory. They are words, words, words: that is not love. Love is concrete, every day. Jesus asks us to follow his commandments, which are summarized in the following: \u201cthat you love one another as I have loved you\u201d (v. 12). (Regina Caeli, 6 May 2018)",
            "If I remain united to Jesus, his love can reach the other and draw him to it, to His friendship. And this love for the other cannot be reserved for exceptional moments, but must be constant in our lives. That is why we are called, for example, to safeguard the elderly like a precious treasure and with love even if they cause economic difficulties and inconveniences, but we must safeguard them. This is why we must give all the assistance possible to the sick, even in the final stages. This is why unborn children are always to be welcomed; this is why, ultimately, life is always to be protected and loved, from conception to its natural end. And this is love. We are loved by God in Jesus Christ who asks us to love one another as he loves us. But we cannot do this if we do not have his same Heart within us. The Eucharist, in which we are called to participate every Sunday, has the aim of forming the Heart of Christ within us, so that our entire life may be guided by his generous attitudes.

        "evangelho": "From the Gospel according to Matthew\nMt 26,14-27,66\nOne of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot,\nwent to the chief priests and said,\n\"What are you willing to give me\nif I hand him over to you?\"\nThey paid him thirty pieces of silver,\nand from that time on he looked for an opportunity\nto hand him over.\n\nOn the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,\nthe disciples approached Jesus and said,\n\"Where do you want us to prepare\nfor you to eat the Passover?\"\nHe said,\n\"Go into the city to a certain man and tell him,\n'The teacher says, \"My appointed time draws near;\nin your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples.\"'\"\nThe disciples then did as Jesus had ordered,\nand prepared the Passover.\n\nWhen it was evening,\nhe reclined at table with the Twelve.\nAnd while they were eating, he said,\n\"Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.\"\nDeeply distressed at this,\nthey began to say to him one after another,\n\"Surely it is not I, Lord?\"\nHe said in reply,\n\"He who has dipped his hand into the dish with me\nis the one who will betray me.\nThe Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him,\nbut woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.\nIt would be better for that man if he had never been born.\"\nThen Judas, his betrayer, said in reply,\n\"Surely it is not I, Rabbi?\"\nHe answered, \"You have said so.\"\n\nWhile they were eating,\nJesus took bread, said the blessing,\nbroke it, and giving it to his disciples said,\n\"Take and eat; this is my body.\"\nThen he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,\n\"Drink from it, all of you,\nfor this is my blood of the covenant,\nwhich will be shed on behalf of many\nfor the forgiveness of sins.\nI tell you, from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine\nuntil the day when I drink it with you new\nin the kingdom of my Father.\"\nThen, after singing a hymn,\nthey went out to the Mount of Olives.\n\nThen Jesus said to them,\n\"This night all of you will have your faith in me shaken,\nfor it is written:\nI will strike the shepherd,\nand the sheep of the flock will be dispersed;\nbut after I have been raised up,\nI shall go before you to Galilee.\"\nPeter said to him in reply,\n\"Though all may have their faith in you shaken,\nmine will never be.\"\nJesus said to him,\n\"Amen, I say to you,\nthis very night before the cock crows,\nyou will deny me three times.\"\nPeter said to him,\n\"Even though I should have to die with you,\nI will not deny you.\"\nAnd all the disciples spoke likewise.\n\nThen Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane,\nand he said to his disciples,\n\"Sit here while I go over there and pray.\"\nHe took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,\nand began to feel sorrow and distress.\nThen he said to them,\n\"My soul is sorrowful even to death.\nRemain here and keep watch with me.\"\nHe advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying,\n\"My Father, if it is possible,\nlet this cup pass from me;\nyet, not as I will, but as you will.\"\nWhen he returned to his disciples he found them asleep.\nHe said to Peter,\n\"So you could not keep watch with me for one hour?\nWatch and pray that you may not undergo the test.\nThe spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"\nWithdrawing a second time, he prayed again,\n\"My Father, if it is not possible that this cup pass\nwithout my drinking it, your will be done!\"\nThen he returned once more and found them asleep,\nfor they could not keep their eyes open.\nHe left them and withdrew again and prayed a third time,\nsaying the same thing again.\nThen he returned to his disciples and said to them,\n\"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest?\nBehold, the hour is at hand\nwhen the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.\nGet up, let us go.\nLook, my betrayer is at hand.\"\n\nWhile he was still speaking,\nJudas, one of the Twelve, arrived,\naccompanied by a large crowd, with swords and clubs,\nwho had come from the chief priests and the elders\nof the people.\nHis betrayer had arranged a sign with them, saying,\n\"The man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him.\"\nImmediately he went over to Jesus and said,\n\"Hail, Rabbi!\" and he kissed him.\nJesus answered him,\n\"Friend, do what you have come for.\"\nThen stepping forward they laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.\nAnd behold, one of those who accompanied Jesus\nput his hand to his sword, drew it,\nand struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.\nThen Jesus said to him,\n\"Put your sword back into its sheath,\nfor all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\nDo you think that I cannot call upon my Father\nand he will not provide me at this moment\nwith more than twelve legions of angels?\nBut then how would the Scriptures be fulfilled\nwhich say that it must come to pass in this way?\"\nAt that hour Jesus said to the crowds,\n\"Have you come out as against a robber,\nwith swords and clubs to seize me?\nDay after day I sat teaching in the temple area,\nyet you did not arrest me.\nBut all this has come to pass\nthat the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled.\"\nThen all the disciples left him and fled.\n\nThose who had arrested Jesus led him away\nto Caiaphas the high priest,\nwhere the scribes and the elders were assembled.\nPeter was following him at a distance\nas far as the high priest's courtyard,\nand going inside he sat down with the servants\nto see the outcome.\nThe chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin\nkept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus\nin order to put him to death,\nbut they found none,\nthough many false witnesses came forward.\nFinally two came forward who stated,\n\"This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God\nand within three days rebuild it.'\"\nThe high priest rose and addressed him,\n\"Have you no answer?\nWhat are these men testifying against you?\"\nBut Jesus was silent.\nThen the high priest said to him,\n\"I order you to tell us under oath before the living God\nwhether you are the Christ, the Son of God.\"\nJesus said to him in reply,\n\"You have said so.\nBut I tell you:\nFrom now on you will see 'the Son of Man\nseated at the right hand of the Power'\nand 'coming on the clouds of heaven.'\"\nThen the high priest tore his robes and said,\n\"He has blasphemed!\nWhat further need have we of witnesses?\nYou have now heard the blasphemy;\nwhat is your opinion?\"\nThey said in reply,\n\"He deserves to die!\"\nThen they spat in his face and struck him,\nwhile some slapped him, saying,\n\"Prophesy for us, Christ: who is it that struck you?\"\n\nNow Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard.\nOne of the maids came over to him and said,\n\"You too were with Jesus the Galilean.\"\nBut he denied it in front of everyone, saying,\n\"I do not know what you are talking about!\"\nAs he went out to the gate, another girl saw him\nand said to those who were there,\n\"This man was with Jesus the Nazorean.\"\nAgain he denied it with an oath,\n\"I do not know the man!\"\nA little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter,\n\"Surely you too are one of them;\neven your speech gives you away.\"\nAt that he began to curse and to swear,\n\"I do not know the man.\"\nAnd immediately a cock crowed.\nThen Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken:\n\"Before the cock crows you will deny me three times.\"\nHe went out and began to weep bitterly.\n\nWhen it was morning,\nall the chief priests and the elders of the people\ntook counsel against Jesus to put him to death.\nThey bound him, led him away,\nand handed him over to Pilate, the governor.\n\nThen Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had been condemned,\ndeeply regretted what he had done.\nHe returned the thirty pieces of silver\nto the chief priests and elders, saying,\n\"I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.\"\nThey said,\n\"What is that to us?\nLook to it yourself.\"\nFlinging the money into the temple,\nhe departed and went off and hanged himself.\nThe chief priests gathered up the money, but said,\n\"It is not lawful to deposit this in the temple treasury,\nfor it is the price of blood.\"\nAfter consultation, they used it to buy the potter's field\nas a burial place for foreigners.\nThat is why that field even today is called the Field of Blood.\nThen was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah\nthe prophet,\nAnd they took the thirty pieces of silver,\nthe value of a man with a price on his head,\na price set by some of the Israelites,\nand they paid it out for the potter's field\njust as the Lord had commanded me.\n\nNow Jesus stood before the governor, and he questioned him,\n\"Are you the king of the Jews?\"\nJesus said, \"You say so.\"\nAnd when he was accused by the chief priests and elders,\nhe made no answer.\nThen Pilate said to him,\n\"Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?\"\nBut he did not answer him one word,\nso that the governor was greatly amazed.\n\nNow on the occasion of the feast\nthe governor was accustomed to release to the crowd\none prisoner whom they wished.\nAnd at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.\nSo when they had assembled, Pilate said to them,\n\"Which one do you want me to release to you,\nBarabbas, or Jesus called Christ?\"\nFor he knew that it was out of envy\nthat they had handed him over.\nWhile he was still seated on the bench,\nhis wife sent him a message,\n\"Have nothing to do with that righteous man.\nI suffered much in a dream today because of him.\"\nThe chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds\nto ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus.\nThe governor said to them in reply,\n\"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\"\nThey answered, \"Barabbas!\"\nPilate said to them,\n\"Then what shall I do with Jesus called Christ?\"\nThey all said,\n\"Let him be crucified!\"\nBut he said,\n\"Why? What evil has he done?\"\nThey only shouted the louder,\n\"Let him be crucified!\"\nWhen Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all,\nbut that a riot was breaking out instead,\nhe took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd,\nsaying, \"I am innocent of this man's blood.\nLook to it yourselves.\"\nAnd the whole people said in reply,\n\"His blood be upon us and upon our children.\"\nThen he released Barabbas to them,\nbut after he had Jesus scourged,\nhe handed him over to be crucified.\n\nThen the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium\nand gathered the whole cohort around him.\nThey stripped off his clothes\nand threw a scarlet military cloak about him.\nWeaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head,\nand a reed in his right hand.\nAnd kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying,\n\"Hail, King of the Jews!\"\nThey spat upon him and took the reed\nand kept striking him on the head.\nAnd when they had mocked him,\nthey stripped him of the cloak,\ndressed him in his own clothes,\nand led him off to crucify him.\n\nAs they were going out, they met a Cyrenian named Simon;\nthis man they pressed into service\nto carry his cross.\n\nAnd when they came to a place called Golgotha\n\u2014which means Place of the Skull \u2014,\nthey gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall.\nBut when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.\nAfter they had crucified him,\nthey divided his garments by casting lots;\nthen they sat down and kept watch over him there.\nAnd they placed over his head the written charge against him:\nThis is Jesus, the King of the Jews.\nTwo revolutionaries were crucified with him,\none on his right and the other on his left.\nThose passing by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying,\n\"You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,\nsave yourself, if you are the Son of God,\nand come down from the cross!\"\nLikewise the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him and said,\n\"He saved others; he cannot save himself.\nSo he is the king of Israel!\nLet him come down from the cross now,\nand we will believe in him.\nHe trusted in God;\nlet him deliver him now if he wants him.\nFor he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\"\nThe revolutionaries who were crucified with him\nalso kept abusing him in the same way.\n\nFrom noon onward, darkness came over the whole land\nuntil three in the afternoon.\nAnd about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice,\n\"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\"\nwhich means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\nSome of the bystanders who heard it said,\n\"This one is calling for Elijah.\"\nImmediately one of them ran to get a sponge;\nhe soaked it in wine, and putting it on a reed,\ngave it to him to drink.\nBut the rest said,\n\"Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to save him.\"\nBut Jesus cried out again in a loud voice,\nand gave up his spirit.\n\nHere all kneel and pause for a short time.\n\nAnd behold, the veil of the sanctuary\nwas torn in two from top to bottom.\nThe earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs were opened,\nand the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.\nAnd coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection,\nthey entered the holy city and appeared to many.\nThe centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus\nfeared greatly when they saw the earthquake\nand all that was happening, and they said,\n\"Truly, this was the Son of God!\"\nThere were many women there, looking on from a distance,\nwho had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.\nAmong them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph,\nand the mother of the sons of Zebedee.\n\nWhen it was evening,\nthere came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph,\nwho was himself a disciple of Jesus.\nHe went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus;\nthen Pilate ordered it to be handed over.\nTaking the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen\nand laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock.\nThen he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb\nand departed.\nBut Mary Magdalene and the other Mary\nremained sitting there, facing the tomb.\n\nThe next day, the one following the day of preparation,\nthe chief priests and the Pharisees\ngathered before Pilate and said,\n\"Sir, we remember that this impostor while still alive said,\n'After three days I will be raised up.'\nGive orders, then, that the grave be secured until the third day,\nlest his disciples come and steal him and say to the people,\n'He has been raised from the dead.'\nThis last imposture would be worse than the first.\"\nPilate said to them,\n\"The guard is yours;\ngo, secure it as best you can.\"\nSo they went and secured the tomb\nby fixing a seal to the stone and setting the guard.",

            "Jesus says one thing from the Cross, one thing alone: \u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d (Mt 27:46). These are powerful words. Jesus had suffered the abandonment of his own, who had fled. But the Father remained for him. Now, in the abyss of solitude, for the first time he calls him by the generic name \u201cGod\u201d. And \u201cin a loud voice\u201d he asks the question \u201cwhy?\u201d (\u2026) Why did all this take place? Once again, it was done for our sake, to serve us. So that when we have our back to the wall, when we find ourselves at a dead end, with no light and no way of escape, when it seems that God himself is not responding, we should remember that we are not alone. Jesus experienced total abandonment in a situation he had never before experienced in order to be one with us in everything. (Palm Sunday, XXXV World Youth Day, 5 April 2020)"

Why ask me?\nAsk those who heard me what I said to them.\nThey know what I said.\u201d\nWhen he had said this, \none of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, \n\u201cIs this the way you answer the high priest?\u201d\nJesus answered him,\n\u201cIf I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; \nbut if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?\u201d\nThen Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.\nNow Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm.\nAnd they said to him,\n\u201cYou are not one of his disciples, are you?\u201d\nHe denied it and said,\n\u201cI am not.\u201d\nOne of the slaves of the high priest, \na relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, \n\u201cDidn\u2019t I see you in the garden with him?\u201d\nAgain Peter denied it.\nAnd immediately the cock crowed.\nThen they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium.\nIt was morning.\nAnd they themselves did not enter the praetorium, \nin order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.\nSo Pilate came out to them and said, \n\u201cWhat charge do you bring against this man?\u201d\nThey answered and said to him,\n\u201cIf he were not a criminal, \nwe would not have handed him over to you.\u201d\nAt this, Pilate said to them, \n\u201cTake him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.\u201d\nThe Jews answered him, \n\u201cWe do not have the right to execute anyone,\u201c \nin order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled\nthat he said indicating the kind of death he would die.\nSo Pilate went back into the praetorium \nand summoned Jesus and said to him, \n\u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d\nJesus answered,\n\u201cDo you say this on your own \nor have others told you about me?\u201d\nPilate answered,\n\u201cI am not a Jew, am I?\nYour own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me.\nWhat have you done?\u201d\nJesus answered,\n\u201cMy kingdom does not belong to this world.\nIf my kingdom did belong to this world, \nmy attendants would be fighting \nto keep me from being handed over to the Jews.\nBut as it is, my kingdom is not here.\u201d\nSo Pilate said to him,\n\u201cThen you are a king?\u201d\nJesus answered,\n\u201cYou say I am a king.\nFor this I was born and for this I came into the world, \nto testify to the truth.\nEveryone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\u201d\nPilate said to him, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d\nWhen he had said this,\nhe again went out to the Jews and said to them,\n\u201cI find no guilt in him.\nBut you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover.\nDo you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\u201d\nThey cried out again,\n\u201cNot this one but Barabbas!\u201d\nNow Barabbas was a revolutionary.\nThen Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.\nAnd the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, \nand clothed him in a purple cloak, \nand they came to him and said,\n\u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d\nAnd they struck him repeatedly.\nOnce more Pilate went out and said to them, \n\u201cLook, I am bringing him out to you, \nso that you may know that I find no guilt in him.\u201d\nSo Jesus came out, \nwearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak.\nAnd he said to them, \u201cBehold, the man!\u201d\nWhen the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, \n\u201cCrucify him, crucify him!\u201d\nPilate said to them,\n\u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him.\nI find no guilt in him.\u201d\nThe Jews answered, \n\u201cWe have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, \nbecause he made himself the Son of God.\u201d\nNow when Pilate heard this statement,\nhe became even more afraid, \nand went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, \n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\nJesus did not answer him.\nSo Pilate said to him,\n\u201cDo you not speak to me?\nDo you not know that I have power to release you \nand I have power to crucify you?\u201d\nJesus answered him,\n\u201cYou would have no power over me \nif it had not been given to you from above.\nFor this reason the one who handed me over to you\nhas the greater sin.\u201d\nConsequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, \n\u201cIf you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar.\nEveryone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.\u201d\nWhen Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out \nand seated him on the judge\u2019s bench \nin the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.\nIt was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon.\nAnd he said to the Jews,\n\u201cBehold, your king!\u201d\nThey cried out,\n\u201cTake him away, take him away!  Crucify him!\u201d\nPilate said to them,\n\u201cShall I crucify your king?\u201d\nThe chief priests answered,\n\u201cWe have no king but Caesar.\u201d\nThen he handed him over to them to be crucified.\nSo they took Jesus, and, carrying the cross himself, \nhe went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, \nin Hebrew, Golgotha.\nThere they crucified him, and with him two others, \none on either side, with Jesus in the middle.\nPilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross.\nIt read,\n\u201cJesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.\u201d\nNow many of the Jews read this inscription, \nbecause the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; \nand it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.\nSo the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, \n\u201cDo not write \u2018The King of the Jews,\u2019\nbut that he said, \u2018I am the King of the Jews\u2019.\u201d\nPilate answered,\n\u201cWhat I have written, I have written.\u201d\nWhen the soldiers had crucified Jesus, \nthey took his clothes and divided them into four shares, \na share for each soldier.\nThey also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, \nwoven in one piece from the top down.\nSo they said to one another, \n\u201cLet\u2019s not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be, \u201c \nin order that the passage of Scripture might be fulfilled that says:\nThey divided my garments among them,\nand for my vesture they cast lots.\nThis is what the soldiers did.\nStanding by the cross of Jesus were his mother\nand his mother\u2019s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,\nand Mary of Magdala.\nWhen Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved\nhe said to his mother, \u201cWoman, behold, your son.\u201d\nThen he said to the disciple,\n\u201cBehold, your mother.\u201d\nAnd from that hour the disciple took her into his home.\nAfter this, aware that everything was now finished, \nin order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, \nJesus said, \u201cI thirst.\u201d\nThere was a vessel filled with common wine.\nSo they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop \nand put it up to his mouth.\nWhen Jesus had taken the wine, he said,\n\u201cIt is finished.\u201d\nAnd bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.\nHere all kneel and pause for a short time.\nNow since it was preparation day,\nin order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath,\nfor the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, \nthe Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken \nand that they be taken down.\nSo the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first \nand then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.\nBut when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, \nthey did not break his legs, \nbut one soldier thrust his lance into his side, \nand immediately blood and water flowed out.\nAn eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; \nhe knows that he is speaking the truth, \nso that you also may come to believe.\nFor this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled:\nNot a bone of it will be broken.\nAnd again another passage says:\nThey will look upon him whom they have pierced.\nAfter this, Joseph of Arimathea, \nsecretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, \nasked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus.\nAnd Pilate permitted it.\nSo he came and took his body.\nNicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, \nalso came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes \nweighing about one hundred pounds.\nThey took the body of Jesus \nand bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, \naccording to the Jewish burial custom.\nNow in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, \nand in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.\nSo they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; \nfor the tomb was close by.",

            "The Gospel says that Jesus \u201cappointed twelve, to be with Him, and to be sent out to preach\u201d (Mk 3:14); two things: to be with him and to send them to preach. There is one aspect that seems contradictory: He called them to be with him and to go and preach. One would say: either one or the other, either stay or go. But no: for Jesus there is no going without staying and there is no staying without going. It is not easy to understand this, but that\u2019s the way it is. Let us try to understand a little bit what is the sense in which Jesus says these things. First of all, there is no going without staying : before sending the disciples forth on mission, Christ \u2014 the Gospel says \u2014 \u201ccalls them to himself\u201d (cf. Mt 10:1). The proclamation is born from the encounter with the Lord; every Christian activity, especially the mission, begins from there. Not from what is learnt in an academy. No, no! It begins from the encounter with the Lord. Witnessing him, in fact, means radiating him; but, if we do not receive his light, we will be extinguished; if we do not spend time with him, we will bear ourselves instead of him \u2014 I am bringing myself and not him \u2014 and it will all be in vain. So only those who remain with him can bring the Gospel of Jesus. Anyone who does not remain with him cannot bear the Gospel. He will bring ideas, but not the Gospel. Equally, however, there is no staying without going. In fact, following Christ is not an inward-looking fact: without proclamation, without service, without mission, the relationship with Jesus does not grow. (General Audience, 15 February 2023)"

We note that the text emphasizes that \u201che rose\u201d. Why is this detail so important? Because in those days he who was seated had authority over the others who stood before him to listen to him or, as in that case, to pay taxes. He who sat, in short, had power. The first thing Jesus does is to detach Matthew from power: from sitting to receive others, He sets him in motion towards others, not receiving, no: he goes out to others. He makes him leave a position of supremacy in order to put him on an equal footing with his brothers and sisters, and open to him the horizons of service. This is what he does, and this is fundamental for Christians. Do we, disciples of Jesus, we, Church, sit around waiting for people to come, or do we know how to get up, to set out with others, to seek others? Saying, \u201cBut let them come to me, I am here, let them come\u201d, is a non-Christian position. No, you go to seek them out, you take the first step.
